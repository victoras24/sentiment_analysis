20,20,Sophiesssss,4,Fantastic,5,18/09/2022,"We visited fat mamas after a friend recommended to my parents who recommended to my sister who then recommended to us!    6 adults, 3 year old girl and 1 year old boy. Well… entertainment was fabulous my little girl loved the dancing and would like to apply in the future! And our son seemed pretty chuffed to find himself a blond babe to hold him haha. The dancing was so much fun and the singing even better! All in all just a wonderful atmosphere full of family celebrations and lots of laughs!    We really enjoyed the food, regulars to Cyprus (half Greek) it was actually really nice to not have the same Greek food and have something different whilst here! (Let’s be honest once you’ve had a meze there’s only so much more you can go for)    For the children we ordered the childrens pizza and some fries and that was plenty for them to share! I had the steak and halloumi fajitas and portion size is big so would suggest maybe sharing and ordering extra tortillas with these, they were honestly the best fajitas I have ever had. My mum had the ribs which were super meaty and super tasty which in my experience is rare in Cyprus and other Greek islands so she was really happy. My dad had a sea bass, partner enchiladas and the others got some burgers. All the food was really yummy and full of flavour it was honestly like TGI FRIDAYS had collaborated with TUI we adored the girls and could really see how much work they have put in to make a wonderful show suitable for all the family!    Drinks - there is a happy hour and would recommend getting there early to take advantage of this. We had various cocktails, beers and soft drinks for drivers and kids and got them241 during the happy hoursss    We had such a great time at fat mamas that we are looking to return for a second time this holiday. We have done lots of lovely things and the one request from the children and the family is that we return for an evening there before we leave for another year!    Basically after all my rambling is that if you want yummy food, great entertainment and fabulous service this is the place for you!",POSITIVE,0.999424934387207

Absolutely fantastic night... food was great (we all had Mexican except our 9-year-old daughter who had the ribs from the children's menu) So tasty and so much food! not one of us finished, but it was happily bagged up for us to take back to our holiday stay. Entertainment is brilliant, daughter was very happy to meet Fat Mama and even had her face painted on the sidewalk next to our table while we finished up.

Food was not very good the night we visited, we were a family of 8 and 3 of the burgers that was ordered was not good at all. We had quite a long wait from ordering to food arriving and staff too busy to take drinks orders.  It was quite expensive for what we had, maybe it was just an off night for the restaurant, but would not go back.",NEGATIVE,0.9991328120231628

The dancers were great and we had a visit from Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy. The food was excellent. Shrimp cocktail was lush . The ribs are amazing but be warned they are big portions so go for the small size is my advice. Drinks are good quality although some brands are a bit expensive. Great Liqueur Coffee.

Loved the entertainment part of the whole restaurant experience.  Every night it’s entertainment night…    If you pay by cash you get 5% of your bill which is nice.

30,30,Bexsutton,65,Good but not great,3,04/09/2022,"I was excited to visit due to all the hype but was disappointed, although they were very accommodating for our large party it was a pain we couldn’t separate bills per family as all have different opinions on service charge/tips etc so was a pain working it out, food was bland, portions too big, my brother paid €40 for a steak and only ate half as he said it was like an old boot, we were charged for 7 bottles of water at €2.40 each but only had 4, the entertainment stayed solely at the entrance although the videos online lead us to believe it was a bit of a noisy wild night dancing around everyone etc but it was not, to be honest I was quite bored, good night but not by any means great",NEGATIVE,0.9989675283432007

32,32,RoxyAndOzzie,34,Fun fun fun,5,30/08/2022,"We loved spending time at Fat Mama's during our time in Paphos. We did not eat here but we spent a few nights drinking here. At stages throughout the night, they have a dance show where 3 woman come on for around 15 minutes, every night we were there it was different and they really entertained the crowd, perfect fot the children to watch on the 'front row' whilst the parents could continue eating/drinking, the girls even posed for photos at the end. We felt some staff members worked considerably harder than others, one female in particular was cleaning tables, seating people down, taking orders, taking payments when 2 gentleman seemed to just be walking around, so hats of to her!!!",POSITIVE,0.9904965162277222

37,37,nicolegQ9279DW,3,Not worth the hype,2,24/08/2022,"Heard so many good things about this place.tje food was plentiful and nice but it certainly isn't worth the hype that surrounds this place there is much better entertainment at other local bars and of much higher quality.

38,38,Geoff B,22,Inexpensive but not value for money,2,15/08/2022,"I’ll start with a summary. This is a fun restaurant, perfect for those with large appetites and no sense of taste.  This is a popular theme/gimmick restaurant in as much as every 20 minutes, 3 girls come out and dance for a couple of minutes. They even dressed as characters in large costumes at one point but the costumes were threadbare and it seemed quite awkward. The food was bland at best. I ordered the beef fajitas and there could not have been any seasoning added whatsoever - not even salt and pepper. I cannot remember a time where I was so disappointed in my food. I was given about 1 teaspoon of guacamole to cover 4 wraps. My wife and daughter had chicken salads and they were ok. The worst part were the drinks; we were happy to have arrived just in time for the 2 for 1 cocktail offer. I ordered mojitos and my wife ordered Margaritas. Neither appeared to contain more than a dribble of alcohol. - we certainly couldn’t taste it. The kids had Fanta but they said they didn’t taste like Fanta. Portion sizes are large but bulked up by cheap ingredients. Service was fine and atmosphere was fun, although the entertainers did ask the table behind us if their young child could pretend it was his birthday so they could perform their cheesy happy birthday routine - the poor lad didn’t look happy",NEGATIVE,0.8267494440078735
39,39,F2266IJclairer,1,Great night as always,5,14/08/2022,Visited many times in the past & it’s always a great experience. Food amazing though portions are huge so if ordering a starter beware. Staff are great and entertainment is fun. Prices obviously vary I ordered a pizza which was only about £10 but my friend has to have the rattlesnake steak when he visits which was £30. Also can’t order wine by the glass so a bottle set us back £24 which would be fine if you can share. We went quite late about 9.30 and had to wait about 15 mins if you go peak time then expect a longer wait but if you’re in no rush then it’s worth it,POSITIVE,0.9961121678352356
40,40,markwX7571FR,4,If in Paphos well worth a visit.,5,11/08/2022,Great food and excellent service. Pizzas are really good. Portions are large.

41,41,markww86,15,Disappointed,1,11/08/2022,"Confused by the good reviews on here. We were really disappointed with all our food. The focus seems to be on quantity rather than quality. Massive portions of really poor quality tasteless food.  The only thing worse than the food was the service. We waited a good 15 minutes at the entrance waiting to be seated (at a booked table), then waited another 30 minutes on someone taking our food order, then waited and waited for our food to be served.  Much better food and service nearby, we won’t be back.",NEGATIVE,0.999765932559967

If you want a quiet meal you really need to avoid though as its full on here. Every 20 mins or so, ladies come out and sing and dance to a theme. They are actually quite talented to be fair.  Its a noisy, extremely busy restaurant, which at times seems chaotic but its a great meal out for families especially with young children. Overall worth a visit!",POSITIVE,0.9993818998336792

The cheesy garlic bread is fantastic and was still as good as it was the first time we came. Burgers are massive and ribs and pizza are all firm favourites. Portion sizes are big esp for starter. It is more than a restuurant experience, there is dancer's and singing approx every 15/20mins and even Stavros Flatley paid a visit whilst were there.

Where to start the food portions are the biggest you will ever see  .  Started with nachos and it would have served 3    Main course was fajitas and I 4 tortias.

From the amazing front of house staff, a bubbly and talented lady from Essex uk, to the superbly efficient table staff and the entertainers, fat mammas delivered an evening that stood out during our holiday. The starter was the size of a main meal… honestly, the bruschetta was basically a whole loaf of bread (!!) and the truly delicious pasta was to die for. we did not leave hungry and could not manage a dessert, despite the desserts looking delicious!

Nice staff but nobody really checks on you once you've ordered. My husband had ribs, the small portion which were massive, and I had prawns in wine and garlic. It came with rice, a baked potato and a salad. The portions are just too big but the food itself is good. Also had a milkshake which was just milk and strawberry syrup so a little disappointing. Had to ask for the bill a few times and in the end just left cash as nobody came with the card machine. The night we went there was a trio dancing to various songs.",NEGATIVE,0.994737446308136

You’ll need to wait like everyone else now” This was behind approx 14 people. When I asked what was the point on us booking, he said the booking only keeps the table free??? He didn’t know his left hand from his right!! Eventually sat down and ordered drinks, but after waiting a further 20 mins, we still didn’t have our drinks so we told the waitress to cancel the order and left.

55,55,SurreyMerc,34,Alright if you like that sort of thing.,3,25/06/2022,After listening to people at our hotel saying about this place we thought we would give it a go. Arrived at about 6.30 pm & got a table. If you go later than about 7 you will struggle to get a table. Also before 7pm it's 15 % early bird discount so we were told. All I can say is its overated & nothing special. It seems that families & younger people like this place but not us. More emphasis should be placed on the quality of the food & not the entertainment that appears about every 20 minutes or so. There is a good choice of food but it's just like being back in England at a Harvester or Smith & Westerns. Overpriced for what you get.,NEGATIVE,0.9964779019355774

The staff went above and beyond for us from start to finish………My husband and I arrived literally just after he was bitten/stung by an insect. He has anaphylactic shocks to Bee and wasps stings. He had already started with the symptoms of swelling and redness, the owner/manager went out of her way to get things to help him. Even offered to get a family member who is a nurse on standby in case it turned nasty. Luckily it calmed down, constant checks, with care and compassion including offers of assistance and natural remedies to help. Even sent us away with supplies. We Can not thank her enough for her care and compassion. What was a scary and very anxious situation for us was made much easier to cope with.  The food was amazing!!

The food is fabulous (ribs, enchiladas, etc)., and arrives in very generous quantities. It does help if you're a carnivore, although they do have veggie options. Someone in my party let slip that it had recently been my birthday, so I had a not unpleasant surprise during the evening! It's a fantastic place to visit, especially if you have children who appreciate their meat. The dancers put on a great show and work really hard for their money. We will definitely return.

65,65,Nick W,12,Holiday evening meal,5,02/05/2022,"Thought Fat Mamas was so good that we tried it for a 2nd time just to make sure.  Firstly the staff are very engaging and friendly. Very jolly from the the man on the door the waiters/waitresses and the cooks.  The food is all cooked fresh and they are happy to give you time between courses, even asking when you will be ready for mains/deserts.  We have had the mushrooms and the brusetta for starts and the burger and ribs for mains. Partner had the mushrooms and the lasagne and previously the enchiladas.  I would have to say that this place is not called Fat Mamas for nothing. We have not managed to finish any of the dishes served. I believe that ""Man V Food"" would struggle. So always large portions.  They have some dancers for entertainment and some music, all of which is great fun and makes the evening more enjoyable.

It took a long time for our orders to be taken and a long time for the food and drink to come out. It was really difficult to get the attention of the staff members and when I politely said I had been waiting 30 mins for a mojito that still had not arrived. I was told it was taking a long time because they had to crush the ice ( like it was my fault for ordering a complicated drink lol) the food was not very tasty.

The mussels nearly ripped my mouth open as the first 2 I ate had sharp shell in, this was then visible from the shell. Clearly no care when washing them or Perhaps not as the third and final one I ate was full of sand!  They also charge extra for paying on card €10.

Originally we stayed in the Coral Bay Area but ventured to Pafos a couple of times, on our first time in Pafos we walked past ‘Fat Mamas’ took one look at the menu and fell in love and decided that we had to give it a go! We booked through messaging the Fat Mamas restaurant on FB and they couldn’t have been nicer, my gf who is coeliac asked them about what she would be able to have at the restaurant and they were so quick and helpful with their response! The service was impeccable and everyone was very happy to help, some lovely entertainment with some great dancers, and the food really is to die for. I recommend it going for dinner that you do not eat for 48 hours prior to the meal, because believe me you will be full! Great value for money on both food and drinks, what more could you want?",POSITIVE,0.9989985823631287
121,121,QualityPolis,69,Lost the plot,2,10/10/2020,Visited this restaurant many time over the years. Sadly the experience of this week was not great.    Firstly a young guy who was greeting diners thought it was okay to charge up to me and point a temperature gauge at my head which I quickly asked him to desist and point at at my wrist instead.    The waitress was less the helpful and gave no indication on any specials of drinks deals or that a discount was available for cash payment which is poor in my opinion and bordering on being a bit suspect.    The food was way below par. I had fajitas which was basically and small amount of over cooked chicken with a mountain of over cooked peppers and onions.    Between the cries from the staff to the Chef's that compliments from various tables and the constant we've got a birthday in the house or some other celebration bacame a but wearing. Felt like being at a kids birthday party with happy birthday being sang every 10 minutes. I've never known for so many birthdays to be celebrated in the one restaurant.    Definitely won't be back as food was poor and atmosphere left a lot to be desired.    Certainly changed days.,NEGATIVE,0.9992678761482239

127,127,Dindda,184,Fantastic food and a party atmosphere,5,27/09/2020,"We decided to visit Fat Mama’s on our last night in Paphos based on the trip adviser reviews. We wish we had done this earlier! The food was the best we had in the fortnight we were in the area. The portions are huge which meant we struggled slightly but we managed perfectly with our order. The potato skins / veggie potato skins were beautiful, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. The hunters chicken was tender and delicious and the halloumi burger was equally as good. My husband said it was the best halloumi he had eaten all the holiday and that includes a Greek restaurant we had eaten in! The entertainment was an added bonus as it’s rare at the moment with the times we are living in. The three dancers were fantastic- every ten minutes they are performing in new outfits every time! The main cabaret show was very entertaining also with some serious gymnastic skills. All this is included at no extra cost. The food prices are reasonable for the area and the quality and freshness of the food is second to none. Next door is Willys steakhouse which shares staff I believe and it appears to be run by an English family. All staff were friendly and welcoming from the doorman / greeter Samson, to the manager / compare lady who made an effort to speak to us, thanking us for supporting them. It really felt our custom was appreciated. We would recommend Fat Mama’s to anyone visiting Paphos. What a place!",POSITIVE,0.9996484518051147

Staff are always very friendly and run by an English family.    Love entertainment every night, although same routine. Staff are lovely and always come with humour and very inviting.    Only gripe is with the beef. I'm pretty sure it's not beef. This relates to mainly the bolognase and burgers. You can instantly smell / taste something odd.    Haven't experienced this anywhere else on the island. Interestingly enough, O'Neil's over the road has put 100% British beef on their menu.

All of the above is true! The staff greeted us at the door and sat us in an already busy side of the restaurant, despite it only being early. We were told the difference between cowboy Willy’s and fat Mamas and left to make our selections. Stupidly, my partner mentioned that it was my birthday...  As our drinks arrived the queue at the door was already 10 deep, so book a table if you can’t be bothered waiting.  I ordered the small ribs (they were massive) and my partner had the lasagne (only comes in 1 size - humongous). Both were nice.  Then the entertainment began; 3 stunning dancers put smiles on everyone’s faces as they did the first of about 6 2 minute ‘mini shows’.

The food came in generous portions (small ribs would be called large anywhere else!) The dancing and singing was fun. The variety of menu choice is good. You can get 10% off your bill and 2 for 1 on cocktails if you arrive before 7pm. The menu included burgers, pizza, pasta, fajitas (yum!), ribs, chicken, salads, etc. etc. There are a few things preventing a higher star rating. The silly queues (not that we did queue as we were there early) but people were queuing down the street from about 7pm onwards and there were plenty of empty tables. If they had 2 people greeting at the entrance they could clear the queue in the street faster (although maybe the kitchens can't cope?). It isn't that amazing it is worth queuing for it feels like an artificial way to look more popular. The service was somewhat impersonal. There were a lot more friendly family run restaurants nearby where the locals were more interactive, interested in you and gave you bread/iced water/a warm welcome/a free drink/desert etc. No friendly and warm homely feel about Fat Mamas but the food was nice.",POSITIVE,0.9945982694625854

296,296,Glen_Bax,88,Great night out.,4,24/07/2019,"We were recommended to come here by others,  Had a genuinely good night. Food was good (don’t think you are coming to a Michelin star restaurant) it’s a American/Italian style restaurant with large portions, good food, fun entertainment which all added up to a great night out with friends.  From what I can gather you can book between 5pm and 7pm and then it’s a first come first served basis. The restaurant has many seats so I think it will be pretty quick moving.  If you arrive/book before 7pm then you are offered 10% off invoice but you must pay cash and all cocktails are 2 for 1.  We were served by a slightly non charismatic American woman who certainly wasn’t full of smiles to start, although as the evening went on she let her guard down and managed a few smiles and laughs!!! I reckon she may have been the owner and whilst I understand not everyone is the same I think it’s important if you are meeting/greeting and seating people you should smile a little more...but don’t worry we will be back!!  Service overall was perfectly ok, the attention levels were higher at the start and I think when the staff realise your not going to vacate your table straight after food then they tend to leave you alone and concentrate on others, which was perfectly acceptable.  The dancers/entertainers were really good fun with a wide mix of little shows throughout the evening and a little 15 min show towards the end.  Definitely worth a visit, probably the more the merrier and after a few cocktails it’s makes for a genuinely good nights fun..,",POSITIVE,0.9991758465766907

300,300,Janette K,75,Great restaurant for families,5,21/07/2019,The food is good value for money as the portions are huge. So if you don't have a big appetite then I would suggest just have the main course. The large rib portion is the biggest I have ever seen. Would probably feed three. The entertainment throughout the meal is very good quality and will keep the children amused. The only down side is that it is that you have to queue up for a table especially at the weekend. So get there early. There is even a chance that you may have a sighting of the famous Stavros flatley as he is a friend of the owner. All in all a good family evening out but too noisy if you are looking for a quiet meal.,POSITIVE,0.9952215552330017

304,304,ShelDye,28,Really Disappointed,3,16/07/2019,"I've been visiting Fat Mama's two or three times a year for twenty years now. It's always been a great place to eat........... until this time. I'm so disappointed at what I found.    1. Waiting time:- There were two tables for 2 free at the time of our arrival but instead of being seated we were sent to the bar at the back. After one round of drinks (I imagine that was the reason for sending us there, extra income) we were directed to one of those empty tables. Why couldn't we just go there anyway. It was clean and re-set and nobody else was waiting.    2. Waiter:- We had a young lad come to the table who mumbled some intelligible nonsense that only dogs would be able to hear. He looked dishevelled and couldn't even stand upright. I have seen people with his appearance before but only whilst watching Trainspotting!    3. Ambience:- This place used to be buzzing with staff rushing around enthusiastically attending to everyone's needs. Music played and dancing girls celebrated personal anniversaries etc. Shouts of compliments going to the kitchen etc. The ambience along with the staff was lacklustre.    4. Waiting times after ordering:- No problems here, as good as always.    5. Food:- Now, if you've been there several times then you'll know this about the food here - Great quality, big portions. Sadly, this wasn't the case. I ordered a dish I've had several times before. There was only 1/2 the amount there always used to be and it had very little flavour. Geronimo would be very disappointed.    6. Feeling wanted:- Normally in a visit here I would be asked if everything is okay etc. at least three or four times. On this visit I was spoken to twice. Once to take my order and once to pay the bill. I felt invisible.    7. Dancers:- Any visit to Fat Mama's is always topped off by the short Showtime event at the end of the night. The dancers have always been excellent doing some good routines with vigour and good choreography. Dancers in time with each other, great costumes and a show that flowed. Not this time! Really lifeless performance, out of sync with each other and when zombie the waiter turned up to lift one of the girls it had all the grace of a builder lifting his hod up the scaffolding. Although that might be a bit unfair to scaffolding. It was truly awful. The lady that owns this place has always taken great pride in getting good dancers and producing good routines down the years. She would have been devastated to see this. They really let her down.    Synopsis:- I know the economy is difficult in Cyprus right now, especially with the hotels and their 'all inclusive' offers, and this has probably had to lead to some economising and shrink-flation but this was ridiculous. It seems to me that some basic 'care' has gone from the way things are done now. I've no idea what the cause is but I do know this. Reputation is built over a period of years and is destroyed in weeks when you take your eye off the ball. I really hope the couple that run the restaurant re-focus their attention on it and give quite a lot of people quite a big kick up the backside. Paphos with Fat Mama's wouldn't be the same but if they don't get their act together again soon it will only be a matter of time.    I will return again soon and would hope to see a massive improvement. I'll probably come back again next year too................if it's not too late!",NEGATIVE,0.99770587682724

The first 2 were excellent - good service, good entertainment and fantastic food. However whilst we're enjoyed our last visit I was a little disappointed. 3 of us had ordered the same dish - geronimo's chicken surprise, which I'd tried and loved on my first visit. However when mine arrived the sour cream was missing and I had about half the salad amount of the other 2, with only salad leaves in it! There also was no chillies on the top of my chicken which the others had. Disappointing that 3 dishes going to the same table were so different.

Our order was taken quickly and we received our cocktails. The cocktails were basic but nice enough. Our order came shortly after and the plate of food was a feast for the eyes. It looked and tasted amazing! It tasted fresh and extremely flavoursome. Can’t say enough positive things about the food.  During our meal there were 3 women who came out and danced every 3-5 songs. I do not feel they added anything to the overall experience at fat mamas. Their presence was quite baffling to the overall feel of the restaurants style and their dancing felt quite awkward throughout.  Nice restaurant and popular with British people.

Arrived early to be greeted well & sat near entrance which is also where the dancers perform.  Waitress recommended ordering cocktails as 241 between 6-7pm great suggestion & ordered Black Russians as an aperitif- lovely!  We then perused the Menus for Willy’s & Fat Mamas as they are the same place really but offering traditional Mediterranean & also Tex Mex ! Huge choice but eventually chose the haloumi fajitas as I’m a pescatarian with my Wife Marion selecting fillets of Sea Bass!  Both dishes arrived shortly & were huge portions of very tasty food with ample veggies.  Managed to wade our way through the meal successfully but chose to forego dessert in favour of more drinks in time to watch the floor show which was brilliant - great value too at around £25 each including drinks  We will be back!,POSITIVE,0.9855729937553406

I could not finish it & I have a large appetite. My wife ordered enchilada’s, our 9 year old son ordered ribs & little girl had scampi. Not one plate was empty, due to the large portions. We shared two deserts again due to large portions.  We had with the food  3 X cocktails  2 X kids soft drinks  2 X large beers (big bottle, bigger then pint)  The whole lot came to about €60!!!    One of the waitress’s even ordered us a taxi & we were told to wait at our table. The taxi driver will come and get you from your table I thought this was a master stroke so families can enjoy every second of the singing & dancing. Kids were also given coloring in stuff.

I was gutted but decided to leave it and eat my sons potato skins with him and wait for my main. I had cannelloni which was at best 4/10.    There was disappointment all round at our table with the food.    Now for the entertainment, there are three girls which came out dancing in different outfits to various songs. The girls were great, they put a lot of effort into everything they did.    It’s a shame that the dancing girls attention to detail could not be transferred to the kitchen.

The entertainment was great as well, which were dancers 3 female and 1 male, although the male dancer seemed as if he didn't want to be there. Need to change him great value for money and staff were really friendly. Ordered the ribs nice taste and really large portion i must say. Looking around all plates were empty and no-one was in a hurry to leave.  Would have been a 5 star but didn't like the fact that you had to buy a bottle of the imported wine selection or drink a glass of the local stuff. Not impressed!",NEGATIVE,0.7593812942504883

On the first trip I had the chilli con carne which was very tasty with enough kick for you to know it was a chilli and not just mince. Very nice!. The second visit my wife decided to have the ribs which came in two sizes what the restaurant call small and then a larger portion. We asked the lady who sat you down (Maria I think her name was) which size was appropriate and she said the small was enough. She was not joking. The small portion consisted of three racks of ribs and the meat fell from the bone, served with a jacket potato my wife said it was delicious. I had the enchiladas which were also great. In addition they have a group of girls who dance at various points in the evening culminating in a short Caberet show which again breaks up the evening and provides something a little different. Overall very good value for money and well worth a visit.",POSITIVE,0.9987723231315613

On first look we thought it was but is a 25 minute walk from the harbour and is near the shopping mall. Well worth the walk though!    Menu has so much choice, we shared the meat platter between 4 of us to start. It was massive but so were our mains so I think everything is big at Fat Mama's. Mains were delicious and we could not manage a pudding.    Staff were lovely and really accommodating. We turned up with a very hungry toddler and asked straight away if he could have spaghetti bolognese which they sorted in minutes. They all chatted to him and made him feel included. We also asked if they had any yogurt and fruit and they made a special mix for him.

We had a great table right in the middle of the restaurant and it was very busy for a Saturday night and a popular place for locals but mainly tourists. We ordered nachos which were delicious and I ordered Steak Fajitas which were delicious. They have entertainment throughout the evening which was 3 girls who apparently appeared on Britain’s Got Talent! Watch it all the time didn’t recognise them and they just performed dance routines to different tracks but very underwhelming. They also have what I can only describe as an ode to Disney with two people dressed as Fat Mama and what looked like Woody from Toy Story very awkward to watch!

Shared nachos to start which arrived quickly and were lovely. Next course a burger which I have to say was delicious! Rather underwhelming entertainment all night consisting of 3 girls appearing at regular intervals doing the same dance routine, just in different costume changes. Very boring, but apparently they were on BGT, so they must’ve been good right?! Wrong! They all looked slightly awkward and we were glad when they stopped!

Firstly, can I start by saying the lady who greets people at the enterance (sorry, I didn’t get her name, American lady I believe) is an asset to the team, gives a very warm welcome and is so friendly.    It was my first time of trying the ribs, WOW!! They are fantastic!! I got the large ribs (photo attached) it was two full racks of ribs, definitely would recommend this to share or get the “small” which isn’t so small for one person. My partner had the enchiladas which again are fantastic every time. He had the large, there is 4 of these in the large portion or 2 for the small!  I then had the godfather of chocolate cake, this is absolutely massive and accompanied by cream and ice cream but goes down very well after a lovely meal.

Well we got there and got seated straight away. I found the food to be mediocre at best. I didn't expect FROZEN CHIPS to be served with food of this price. Just because the portions are massive doesn't mean its good. The service time was very fast and the waiters are very attentive. 3 women did some singing and dancing every now and then.. I was waiting for the big show and realised that was it. No disrespect to the entertainment team of 3 but I can see dancing like that at any dancing school show. I don't know what we expected from Big Mamas but we both left feeling very disappointed and rather sick from attempting to eat the large portions. We've been spoilt by eating in some lovely restaurants in paphos. Sadly this was not one of them yet it was the most expensive. I did have to chase my change as mentioned by other reviewers, which was embarrassing. We won't be returning when we're next here.

474,474,possy1987,20,Two visits in 1 week,5,17/09/2018,"My partner and I ate here for our first meal in Paphos having been recommended by friends and family & reading all the reviews on here. We weren’t disappointed. We arrived just before 9pm. We had to wait approximately 5/10 minutes for a table. Plenty of staff working hard, serving customers, clearing tables, cleaning down tables & setting back up generally working well as a team.    We were shown to our table and asked if we’d been before, as we hadn’t we were shown how the two menus work (one Italian & one American which you can mix n match).    Not long after we ordered the cabaret show started which lasted for approximately 20 minutes.    The food arrived and the portions were massive and great value.    We also returned on our last night for our “final supper in Cyprus” - we ate just after 6pm. We didn’t have to wait for a table and once seated we were told it was happy hour on cocktails (by one get one half price - the only downside was you got both cocktails at the same time & my strawberry daiquiri was melting & giving me brain freeze & 10% off the bill if paying cash).    Again we weren’t disappointed with the quality or quantity of our food. A great last feed before our flight home.    Highly recommend adding this to your list of restaurants to visit whilst in Paphos.",POSITIVE,0.9967854022979736

You can chose between 2 sets of menus : Fat Mama's or Willy's. You can even have small plates for various dishes. Very reasonably priced.

This is the warmest restaurant we have visited during our stay, all of the staff were friendly and the service was faultless. The quality of the food and portion sizes were excellent, and the prices were very reasonable. The entertainment was good and is a really nice value added experience. We purchased some T- shirts and the waitress was really helpful in assisting us with size selection - when we returned to our apartment and tried the garments on they fitted perfectly. This is the fifth time we have been to Cyprus but the first time to Fat Mama’s, however we will be coming much more in future.

479,479,David M,37,A little surreal and I literally could not eat another bite,4,14/09/2018,"Went here relatively early (still daylight) on a Sunday evening. Was a little surreal as every 10-15 minutes or so these three girls would do a wee dance number in the middle of the restaurant to a well-known tune. Became a little game between us to guess the song as we saw them walk out. It's cheesy but entertaining.    Food was decent but enormous. Managed to get to the point where literally neither of us could eat any more. In fact we went back to the hotel and to bed as we didn't even have room for another beer or cocktail. Never felt so full in my life. Reminded me of the Wafer-thin mint bit from Monty Python.    Top tip: Are you really, really, really sure you need a starter? (If you are going for it, my wife said whatever the cheesy, bacon mushroomy things she had was awesome, although combining that quite large starter with a pizza nearly finished her off!)",POSITIVE,0.8515080809593201

We were sat near a lady doing face painting on all the kids and some mums, it looked like she was doing hair braiding too. I ordered the Steak alamamas i thin it was so tender in a garlic and brandy sauce. my friend ordered the king prawns with seasonal veg. As we waited we must have seen another 10 choices of what we could have had, the spare ribs marked for my next visit. Dinner was as good as it looked the drinks continued and then the cabaret started, what a brilliant show. i heard that Stavros Flatly still does a gig here occasionally, maybe next visit ? i was full up so we shared a chocolate fudge for dessert and it was delicious ... we are definitely going back !",POSITIVE,0.9988710284233093

We were recommended by a friend with a focus on getting the ribs! So glad I got the ribs! Let's tackle a few things :    Atmosphere -    The restaurant has a very lively atmosphere with regular sudden renditions of dance and song down the middle of the tables. The girls dance, sign and sirande everyone who has a birthday. It's not over the top and actually livens the place up well. This is definitely a family / ""not boring"" couple place.    Food -    MASSIVE portions. Don't under-estimate the warnings about portion sizes and think about sharing most of the dishes. This makes the price point absolutely phenomenal. You can seriously stuff your face with delicious food and come back with change from 20 euros.    Drinks -    Decent selection of drinks and in-line with most of the other restaurants. No really fancy cocktails but decent enough to beat a lot of the rubbish pubs on the strip.    Altogether, I'll be back and really enjoyed my time here.

We were served quickly by a courteous and efficient waitress. You are give two menus to choose from: the Italian menu (fat mamas) and the American menu (Willy’s) The food was excellent albeit the portion sizes were not for the faint of heart as they were HUGE off of the American style menu. Everyone finished their meals despite this though.  There were mini “shows” put on through the night for various tables celebrating something and they were entertaining. We refrained from organising one for our brother as we were all more interested in food!

Firstly the portions are huge and if you go for the even larger portions then good luck. First night I chose from the American menu and got the hot BBQ ribs and decided to get the extra large portion which is two full racks of ribs, one rack was massive and to my amazement you get 2 full racks, They were absolutely delicious, The meat just fell off the bones and the sauce was lovely and covered every inch plus the hot sauce I had on top, which also was delicious so asked for more sauce.    The next visit I chose from the Italian menu and got the mussels to start and then the fat mamas pizza and as always went large and once again they never disappointed me, flavours and meats were amazing, the pizza base and crusts were very light and fluffy and cooked to perfection. My wife got a burger and had it medium rare and I tried it and I would go as far to say it was one of my favourite burgers, not just because of the topping but the quality of beef and how perfect and juicy it was cooked.    Everyone on my table was satisfied and left completely full up and had to take some home in a doggy bag, tasted just was good 2 hours later.    Fat mamas also has 3 lovely entertainers which kept the night fun and lively, i'm sure the girls caused a few arguments between couples XD but they are there to entertain so keep staring.

The restaurant was very busy and seems to be connected to the restaurant next door (Willy's). There was music playing in the background and at random times a dance troupe would come and do a dance routine to certain songs. Later in the evening the dance troupe done a 20 minutes (approx) routine which included fire eating. The food was reasonably priced and tasty and the staff were good. The restaurant was busy but at no time did you feel pressured to leave. Fat mama's is a good place to stop at and if you time it right they will throw in a free show.

There is plenty to choose from and it all sounds delicious, but don’t let your eyes be bigger than your belly, because the portions are on the larger side.    We loved the nachos, the nacho chips were different than we were use to which was a pleasant surprise. The lasagne main comes with chips and is gorgeous, as was the burgers. The drinks offers were great value for money and the hostess is keen for customers to get in the offer time which differs from the typical delaying to charge you full price I have experienced in other places.    There is a combination of open air and covered seating with both smoking and non smoking. And I’m passing we saw in the later evening they provide excellent live shows and entertainment.    The only thing that let it down was the customer service. The waitresses were often grouped together giggling and mucking around, or talking to their friends who had walked past while customers sat unchecked or waiting. While we was there early and before the full flow of the night (5pm-ish) I still expected a bit more attention rather than trying to get the attention of 4 waitresses passing for a drink and waiting 10 minuets, whilst they chatted at the beginning of the night. We had an odd experience were we asked for two more glasses of tap water and was refused and told fat mamas only provides bottled water, but we asked another waitress and got them bought straight over, and we was not charged water on the bill.

Menu has plenty of choice, even has two menu's one for Italian and one for american. Me and my boyfriend were going to get two starters and two mains but the waitress kindly advised we just shared the one starter because the portions are huge and we were so happy she said that because the portions at this place are ridiculous. We had nachos to share for a starter which was huge and delicious and I had chicken fajitas and my boyfriend had the small ribs ( but they certainly didn't look small AT ALL) we both absolutely loved our meals. Great portion sizes but don't get carried away with getting loads food because trust me you won't be able to eat all of it. The thing that makes this restaurant different is the entertainment, it was so good to watch the girls do a burlesque show as we ate our meal, made the night even better.

I had chicken wings and nachos to start and billy the kid steak for main, I loved it and had no complaints what so ever.

This for us is very good customer service as we would have not enjoyed or finished our main course, so we shared a starter and i see what she meant.    It was so nice to have a laugh with the team there and then they had a show within then restaurant singing and dancing.

They have dancers on every night. Last night it was a cabaret theme & they had an appearance from Stavros Flatly. It was great fun.    There is so much choice for food as they hand you two different menus when you come in. One for American food and one for Italian. I had Fajitas from the American menu and they were beautiful (massive portions though). My partner had the BBQ ribs which are offered in two sizes & we then shared the biggest slab of chocolate cake I have ever seen in my life.    The staff were very lovely and we noticed people were queuing for a table for most of the night (I think they stopped letting people in after 9pm so that the customers they had could enjoy the Cabernet).    All round excellent review for this one.  Thanks very much!,POSITIVE,0.9997574687004089

Between 6-7pm they do a cash only payment offer with buy one get one free cocktails and 10% off the bill, the only thing that bothered me was that they arrived with 4 cocktails instead of us getting one each, they automatically give you two each, I didn’t like that and felt forced to drink it that way. They have two menus either Italian or American and you can mix and match. They also offer a children’s menu. The food was not bad, we had nachos, burgers, ribs and steak all of which were tasty and cooked well. There is entertainment provided by three dancers which was slightly awkward as it didn’t seem to fit the theme of the restaurant but gave us a laugh so maybe that’s the point. Would we go back?

There are two sizes on the menu, normal or large.... normal takes some stamina to get through ..... and large....well you might need a doggy bag cos it's one hell of a portion if you haven't got what it takes to get through it.    Very reasonably priced food and drinks with special offers for the early birds.    Easy access for disabled but like most of the toilets in the older restaurants there could be an issue here.    The staff are mega friendly and like a laugh with a bit of entertainment.    The layout is basic, but it's set up for fast, easy service with no compromise on the food.

My friend had a pizza and it was a bit over cooked with way too much topping. Drinks menu was good and service was very good - really friendly staff.    They have entertainment - girls dancing. I found it a bit cringey - they were great dancers but it did feel like it was an excuse to put some attractive women in a few skimpy costumes and I didn't feel that comfortable watching. Where were the male dancers to balance it out?!,NEGATIVE,0.9994800686836243

The first waitress was fab but after she was moved off us we were largely ignored. Asking for some black pepper for the pasta seemed odd to them and I was tapped on the shoulder and it was slammed down on the table. As it happens the rubbish battery operated pepper mill didn't help the bland and rubbery pasta taste any better, had it not been a chore get a waiter I would have sent it back earlier, shame we didn't even get offered a second drink to wash it down with. The portions are massive so you get a lot for your money, but it was voted the worst ribs out of 5 different places over the holiday, they seemed fatty and pre cooked with the sauce poured over. All 4 of us were so disappointed that no one wanted to stay for the Halloween party. We won't be back.",NEGATIVE,0.9996228218078613

We said that we must go there for dinner as the menu has many options and there were lots of  Guests so it was clearly popular. Our food came out very quickly and the portions were generous. The steak we ordered was very poor and is what we would call a ‘dogs dinner’. I’ve also had much better pizzas that have been cooked from frozen. It’s like they concentrate on huge portions and quick service but the food has no effort put into it. Wouldn’t return. Very friendly staff but when I put my hand up for service it took a few minutes for anyone to notice me.,NEGATIVE,0.7480705976486206

When we booked to go back this year we couldn’t wait to take our 3 children there, Although we were worried that it wouldn’t live up to our expectations, but we haven’t been disappointed. In our 2 week holiday we have visited twice. Our children loved it. Our daughter said they should change their name to ‘heaven’. Lol. The food portions are huge! And the ribs are AMAZING! I had the chicken with broccoli and tagliatelle in blue cheese sauce (which I’m pretty sure is what I had when we visited 13 years ago!) and it was delicious. We will always make sure we visit Fat Mamas when we visit paphos. We’ve booked to come back next year and will definitely be back. Also, I must mention that while we’ve been on holiday our daughter has been using our money to sort out what notes and coins she needs to pay the bill. Tonight when she did it we didn’t pay much attention as it was throwing it down and we were getting ready for our taxi to pull up outside. When we were half way back in the taxi, the driver had a call from Fat Mamas (my husband had left our taxi drivers card on our table) to say we had paid €50 too much! So we went back for it. But it was very good of them to go out of their way to get in touch with us to let us know. Excellent service, lovely staff, delicious food. Thank you",POSITIVE,0.9991257786750793

Portion sizes would suit even the Americans but it was all well cooked and they were good with a child's menu.

Puts me in mind of the mini discos in Spanish hotels in the 90s.  My only real disappointment cake when we sent our compliments to the chefs and the waiter (Mr Would rather be somewhere else) rolled his eyes and walked over to the kitchen mumbling something and from the kitchen we heard a faint ""Thank you"".

It might not be granted with a Michelin star ,might not even be the best food around but I ll tell you why is worth the visit during your summer holidays (that's when I always go there) It has not one but two different menus to chose from ,one with Tex-mex cousine and one more Italian style. That means you can chose from a variety of big burgers to pizzas and pastas and Mexican dishes or steaks . The prices are logical and the portions are big,some plates I dare say even huge .And all the above with the company of a show,yeah that's right the staff will dance and sing for you from retro to the new hit songs. .It kind of reminds me of ""Fridays"" restaurants in lots of ways (even the welcoming and friendly staff ) only ..with a show .You will see why its one of the first choises among tourists (and not just ) and why is always crouded (most times we had to wait in line to get a table but ok didn't take really that long )  So if you want a different experience and a good values for money place try it out",POSITIVE,0.8705890774726868

It was fairly quiet when we arrived so we were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken.  The waiter advised us that the portions were large and he wasn't joking! We ordered nachos and garlic bread cheese to start and unfortunately had to leave some because there was so much.  I must say the nachos were absolutely beautiful, I could have eaten them all as a main!  We shared a pizza for our main which was lovely, however, our side of onion rings was disappointing as we were expecting home made but they were frozen ones.  Once we had eaten we requested our bill but by this time the restaurant had filled up and was much busier. After 10 minutes the bill had not been brought over so we asked another member of staff. It took a further 10-15 minutes and another reminder from us before we received it.    Overall it was a lovely meal but I've rated it 4* as the service towards the end let it down.",NEGATIVE,0.9929220080375671

The service was a bit slow, however it was fairly busy so we didn't mind that so much and we got off to a good start with some nachos to share, they were loaded with chilli and the usual accompaniments (guacamole, sour cream, salsa, cheese) and were very tasty. The menu is expansive and I mean, if you can think of it, they probably do it (which isn't always a good thing). For main course I ordered spaghetti carbonara, which was really over cooked so it was sloppy and INCREDIBLY bland, there was definitely no seasoning in it whatsoever and the 'bacon' was more like small chunks of Pek. My boyfriend had the ribs, which came recommended by the waitress, to be fair the meat was tender and came off the bone nicely, however it was again very bland and the sauce was more akin to weak Bisto than a genuine BBQ rib style.    Fat Mammas has a reputation for generous portion sizes, which is true, but quality overrides quantity in my opinion and I would have rather had a smaller portion of good food that tastes nice, than a massive portion of food that isn't great.    Unbeknown to us there is also a cabaret act, which consists of two dancers flailing around at breakneck speeds, for me it didn't really add to the experience.    I'd say more focus to providing food that tastes good should be the priority over offering such a massive variety on the menu, large portions or cabaret acts.",NEGATIVE,0.9731221795082092

The dancers came over, and did a little dance and a happy birthday song to which was a fantastic touch with the birthday hat and a cheeky cocktail (there must have been about 8 birthdays that night) but it was nice of the waiter to tell them. A few of us had puddings and after a slight mix up of being brought coke over cake (which we have to laugh about) have to say the best fudge cake ever and it was HUGE!!

829,829,Craigk186337,104,It is a very good night,4,02/09/2017,"I've been coming here for 7 years. The food is actually decent. Don't expect Michelin 5 star but as American/Italian goes it's not bad. The smaller portions are actually very generous.    For me this place isn't about the food, it's the entertainment. My kids love it, I enjoy it too. We were lucky enough on Thursday to see Stavros Flatley. This really did make the night, he was brilliant.    The portions are massive, we had a garlic bread to share which came with about 6 large pieces. I had the prawn cocktail which was nice. My wife had carbonara and shared it with our 6 year old (even the small portion is very big and excellent value too) I went for the mama sized ribs.    My advice is go for the small portions and you will feel like you've had good value. I find if we have the mama portions, we don't eat it all and it really inflates the bill leaving a feeling of the place being expensive.    My only complaints are that the queue is manufactured, if you go early the queue is quite big vs number of empty tables. I'd like to be seated quickly when I get there. Also, having been coming here for 7 years some of the staff being the same l, we've never been recognised as returning customers and are always asked have you been here before. I appreciate its busy and lots of faces to remember but that would be a nice touch for us.    Overall this is a great night out with good food and fantastic entertainment. Will visit again a couple of times next year.",POSITIVE,0.9994940757751465

With that objective I ent with family to Fat Mama's.    The dancing girls were not excellent. Only half a song per routine. Only one could sing, another ""murdered"" happy birthday repeatedly.    The range of food was excellent. However, I found the size of servings to be ridiculous.    I selected the 9 inch meat pizza. It was excellent. In all fairness it was the best pizza I have had for a while, regardless of the country I was in at the time.    My family had other items from the menu. They do a barbecue sauce. It is not good !    My partner tried the pasta a few days later. She had a Bolognese sauce on spaghetti. The pasta was swimming in water. It was as if they did not bother to drain the pasta.    Need I say more ?    That said I heard several people saying that quantity was excellent so they were happy.    I won't be returning.",POSITIVE,0.9023742079734802

We couldn't make a reservation but had no issue being seated, and never had to wait. Food was lovely and as everyone has mentioned... big portions! Really lovely staff, very attentitive and friendly. Didn't have to wait too long for food either, despite how busy it was. We still couldn't resist trying a desert on our 2nd visit though, safe to say we were in a food coma for the rest of the night!    The only downside was the entertainment, I'm not the biggest fan of cabaret and it did cheapen the place in my opinion. On our first visit we were asked if it was anyone's birthday, it wasn't but we still had happy birthday sang to one of my friends and a free cocktail. Which although was funny, it did get a bit repepatitive after hearing it sang to 3 other tables, as well as a wedding anniversary!    Would have loved to have been there when Stavros Flatley were performing though.    I would still highly recommend, makes a nice change from the more 'traditional' restaurants on the harbour.",POSITIVE,0.9946885108947754

We were stuck on a crap table which was very hot ( when we arrived the waiter asked if we had booked, to which I told them their web site stated that they could not take reservations after 7pm ) hence the crap table!

This was no trouble however when moved our glasses were cleared and we lost our drinks. When we drew this to the attention of the waiter he explained that the table had been cleared in error. He did not offer us any other drink. We basically didn't see staff afterwards which made us feel as if we had done something wrong asking to be moved (we have 3 young daughters and they could not stand the smell nor should they). The food was delicious again but as I said disappointed on how we were treated which wasted our experience. We were brought our bill straight after our main meal and not offered a desert. This was obviously a mistake but after what we experienced we felt we were being pushed out.

No waitress came so we flagged down one and ordered our drinks. Our food was ordered some 15 minutes after this, I plumped for the Pepper Steak. This steak comes in 2 sizes, 6oz and a so called Mamas Portion. I ordered the Mamas and waited with excitement as I was starving. The food arrived and my steak was so small I could barely see it under a pint of pepper sauce. I called the waitress over to query if this was the so called Mamas Portion, to which she replied ""I don't know I'll have to check with the kitchen "". The waitress returned with the cheesiest grin you've ever seen and said "" I'm sorry about that, you clearly know your steaks don't you"", I'll get the kitchen to do you the correct one. 10 mins later the steak arrived, I had asked for it to be done medium but once I dug my knife into it, their was more blood running out of it than a burst blood vessel, it was so under done it started mooing at me.

I asked twice until they finally took it to the kitchen on my 3rd request and brought the exact same ribs (now cold) back to me with an added layer of hot sauce added. The fajitas again were plentiful but the price paid for 'steak' was a little disingenuous as it was mainly veg. We had two 12 year olds share a pizza and pasta but the pizza wasn't cooked through and the dough was raw in places.  The place was packed and the staff were too busy to deal with issues.  Not a good €250 spend although the dancers were good.  No ""thank you"" or ""come again"" as we were leaving.  Needless to say, I won't be back.",NEGATIVE,0.9992853999137878

They even perfect a blue fillet.  2. Staff - if they're not enjoying their work, you wouldn't know it. Nothing's too much hassle and they go out their way to please without being in your face or pushy.  3. Entertainment - kids love it. It's all night. It's loud. It's fun.  4.

With 5 microwaves on show, it was obviously that our starter of BBQ ribs had come from there. The staff seemed oblivious to customers, completely the opposite to the majority of other restaurants down the same road.    The main dishes came promptly which in a very busy restaurant is good but I couldn't help thinking the microwave was used again to blast out dish after dish? The burger tasted mediocre, dry and lacked flavour. Came with a good portion of fries and salad. Tried to enjoy this but dancing and cabaret took place and eating my meal became uncomfortable, which I deliberated finished early as my table appeared pretty much on stage.    Overall a disappointing evening and this was the only English food we ate all holiday, Cypriot food has tasted a lot fresher and less greasy.

This definitely passed the time when waiting for food. We had ordered 2 margarita pizzas, coleslaw and cheese cake for dessert. Every time I go abroad the pizza always tastes different, but this time hallelujah!!! They were not, theses pizzas were absolutely gorgeous( one of the best I've tried)  The cheese cake was lovely too, only downside on the dessert was they put far to much sauce on it so it lost its flavour a bit.  The atmosphere was lively, someone was celebrating a birthday,so the dancer came out with a pint and sang happy birthday to him. Then a couple were getting married so the dancers came out with champagne and sang to them. So there was a lot of audience participation. The price of the food and drinks was reasonable.....

I ordered the BBQ ribs which I really enjoyed, cooked very well- meat just fell off the bone as it should. There are 2 menus which you can mix and match, Italian and American. Every 15 minutes or so, dancers come out for a minute which was quite entertaining. The restaurant had a fair amount of locals inside which is always a good sign. Staff very polite and friendly. Food was pretty decent but nothing special. The prices were very fair for the huge portions given. Even kids meal for 6 Euro was huge.

The service at the restaurant was very quick and the portions were huge. We ordered the bruschetta to start and it was more than enough for two people.  We were quite surprised to find there was cabaret entertainment, loud music and dancing which isn't really our scene as we prefer a quiet adult setting, but for those diners who had young children it was a great addition to the experience as the children were entertained.  They also made a very big fuss if you were celebrating e.g. Wedding anniversary or birthday.  The food is not authentic Cypriot/Greek, it serves American, Italian and Mexican.  However from the onset this is made clear and so if you fancy a fun night with food that you could get at home, this is your place!  Only 4 stars because it wasn't our sort of place.",POSITIVE,0.9866940975189209

We were family of 7, ordered 5 main courses: 2 burgers, 1 sicilian chicken, 1 seabass fish, 1 pasta, they were all absolute DISASTER! The burgers were too salty and lukewarm, just not edible. My fish was lukewarm and tasted as if was not fresh, was dry, and in different temperature from the side vegetables that were warm. The Pasta of the kids was just tasteless, no flavor at all. Most of the food was just left uneaten...! :(    When we told them our review, they just said it's our problem and kicked us out, with no compensation whatsoever - needless to say we paid the full bill for food that I wouldn't feed my cat with!    A taxi driver that took us to the airport told us that because they are so crowded, they make the food up front, so it is served not fresh.

It's not a bad place the food was reasonable but not brilliant...my wife's salad was very good, sons chicken burger a bit soggy and my plate was ok...two puddings..the strawberry, ice cream and pancake was disappointing but my wife's fruit salad and ice cream was ok.    So all in all on the food front mixed...service was good and cheerful..they were doing face painting and also have a couple of people dressed up as cartoon characters for photos etc..so good place for families with young kids.",POSITIVE,0.9992675185203552

We were hoping to see the characters for the children, but were told the entertainment didn't start until 7.30pm. We dragged out the dinner to keep the kids going, but after a Britney Spears(!) number, it seemed to peter out so we paid and left without the kids seeing Fat Mama or Cowboy Willy...a slight downer on an otherwise lovely evening.

We ordered the large portion of ribs to share and it came out in less than five minutes.... which meant it had obviously just been microwaved or reheated. We could only eat one or two before deciding to leave. The two for one cocktails are great value but our mojitos tasted like rum and lime cordial.

However, the entertainment was still good. I will not let this visit put me off from visiting if I holiday in Paphos in the future and will just put this down to a 'one off'.

For the main course we both went for the burgers and what a plateful you get. The food was very nice and hot.  If you want a fun night out they do entertainment later on in the evening while you eat.  You can catch the 615 bus from paphos harbour or coral bay and get off at the stop beside McDonalds.

Only chose the small option as I had been advised they were quite big portions, and I couldn't even finish the small one!!!  Went again the following week to meet up with friends, and again it was lovely. I ordered a jacket potato instead of chips the 2nd time and it was one of the best jacket potato's I have ever had :) Our waitress (Marie) was lovely as well, nothing was too much trouble for her.

The place was almost full and had a good mix of young and mature couples together with families with young Children.    I had a steak with a Diane sauce for 24euros which was nice and tasty in itself but was served with frozen thin chips and salad which looked like it had just been emptied from a UK supermarket mixed salad bag.....think Asda.    The place has it's own entertainment to keep your mind away from your very average meal and the three young ladies do a great job of dancing and singing which perhaps explains why you pay a premium price for a meal you will not want to repeat.,NEGATIVE,0.9749577045440674

We will defiantly be returning here for a feed before our holiday is over. Was drinking John smiths Heineken and wood pecker amongst us and the bill was 80 euro. Top place. Just try it.

However, we were very disappointed with the food. 2 of us had burgers, and 2 of us had ribs. It all tasted rather bland, processed and microwaved.

1225,1225,kayw79,58,Supposed to be a nice meal,2,09/09/2016,"I'll start with the positive. The young female waitress who seated us and took out order is their best member of staff by far. I didnt catch her name but she was so helpful and friendly she also had a quick chat with us when she came to our table later in the evening too.    The food portions are huge!! And quite tasty!    Although it's a bar with a variety of entertainment, personally it's too much too often. There should singing, dancing, congratulations and a few more. There is too much going on and it distracts you from the meal.  It was particularly busy when we went and it looked like the servers that were working were too busy, people were queuing to come in which we thought was a good sign.    Asking for the bill was an absolute nightmare! It took the best part of an hour to get it. We originally asked the waiter in the black no.23 shirt for our bill. 20 minutes later we still didn't have it but the tables that asked him after us had been given theirs. So we waited a little bit longer. It was like being ignored all of a sudden nobody came to the corner where we were sat. There was another waiter in black no.20 cleaning and setting a table up for the next day a few tables over. So I said to him we were still waiting and wanted our bill. This was half an hour later. Eventually when we finally got our bill it was plonked on the table and he walked off. Looked at our bill to find that it said cash only which we were a bit confused about. But again there was nobody around to ask. Eventually somebody came over to the table behind so we asked her. And she says because of a deal on cocktails it's a cash only meal and if we want to pay by card the discount is taken off. This would have all been okay had we been told this at the time of ordering our drinks.  When we finally left we were thoroughly annoyed and we will not be returning or recommending.",NEGATIVE,0.997535228729248

The cuisine on offer includes pizzas, pasta and steak - nothing traditionally Cypriot at all.    The service is friendly and as quick as possible, but the venue gets very busy from around 7pm each evening. You can book a table, to avoid waiting in line, but once seated the orders are taken quickly and the food arrives without too much of a wait.    Here at Fat Mama's they celebrate special occasions by singing to the table celebrating at certain times of night Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy will appear to entertain the kids.

As they like to make a fuss over personal celebrations the last time we visited they said they'd get the team to sing....it never happened.  So this time we arrived in Paphos on the Wednesday, and on our stroll out we booked a table for Saturday evening and were told they had a show on. Again, they asked if there were any celebrations (we had a joint birthday celebration), this was noted on our reservation.  Saturday came and the queue was at least 6 families deep so we made our way to the front as we had a reservation. The waiter came and we pointed out our booking and he actually asked if we'd just written it in the book as some people do this!!!!  Anyway, the food service could have been a little faster although the food was really tasty.  The show started.....3 girls from Manchester!! Just what you want to see when you've gone all the way to Cyprus, it was just ok.  In previous years the staff have come out dressed up with coloured wigs on, banging dustbin lids and really getting everybody in a great mood! But, not this time.  Again, the birthdays were not acknowledged despite it being written on our booking and us also mentioning it when ordering!    It was spacious, tasty enough food, service could have been better.....but I'm just not sure what all the hype is about!    We just visited the once and I'm afraid to say that was enough.

I ordered ribs (large) and my wife ordered Fajitas.  Mine was bland so only ate half of it and I'm a big eater and love my food but this was below average.  My wife's was so salty she had a mouthful and left it.  We complained about the levels of salt to staff and eventually manager who after some debate removed it from the bill and rightly so.  All in all I can see why people visit here so much, big portions will always bring people in, and lots of grilled meat does the same.  Would we go back????  Probably not, but maybe we caught them on an off night.  Highlight of night was a live performance from none other than Stavros Flatley & his son.

After we were finally seated we perused the menu and waited 15 minutes for our drinks order to be taken, then waited another 20 minutes before getting up and getting a waitress to order food. Food didnt tak too long to arrive and as before the portions were absolutely enormous-great, or not so great i ordered the lasagne, but it was so creamy (not in a good way) i only ate about a third as i felt like i was going to be sick, signalled my husband who rushed off to get the bill as i was getting very queasy by now.

We were sat down quite quickly though. Staff were nice and the entertainment of watching the 4 girls do a little dance and a costume change for every celebration was a little tiring after a while when we realised this was the ONLY entertainment. 2 characters dressed up for a photo and had a little dance. My daughter had her nails done to the tune of €10. The food was good but nothing special compared to other meals we had on the same strip. I did see on other nights that thy had other entertainment on so I was a little gutted my birthday wasn't as special as I thought it would be. Prices are quite reasonable.

There was no coleslaw or other similar to accompany the meal which is usual in Rib Shacks elsewhere. I like meat but it is just all about the meat. The burgers were also ok but again it was purely about the meat. I think this place is over priced and lacks variety on the plate for what you pay.

Both me and my boyfriend had the burger with bacon and cheese and I can honestly say it is one of the best meals I've ever had. For the price (somewhere around 11-12 euros) it is insanely good.

Always busy, so best to go earlier rather than later to avoid disappointment of a long wait. However I will say they are very accommodating and have never had to wait longer than 20 mins and with a bar of their own have been more than happy to wait.  The food is fabulous. Each time I have visited I have tried different dishes ranging from pasta, pizza and burgers and each one was a success. One thing I will say about fat mama's is the food portions are ENORMOUS !!! You will not go hungry. Small portions and larger portions are available. I would always advise to go small as they are more than enough. Sharing starters could even fill the biggest of appetites. But hey for the very very reasonable prices and the option of doggy bags I would never complain!!  Not a restaurant for a quiet, candlelit meal as throughout the night bursts of performances, whether singing or dancing, are to be expected. A fun and entertaining twist.  Always a great atmosphere for a lively night and a hearty meal.  Would recommend to all those who visit Paphos!!",POSITIVE,0.9995601773262024

We were a group of 13 aged 2, 10, teens and 40+  Great place to celebrate an occasion as the staff make a fuss of you and you may get a free drink!  Staff friendly and same ones as last year with a a bit of singing & dancing every 15-20 mins & a cabaret show later in the evening.  Food is excellent and varied. I would recommend the chicken al a rustica.  There are 2 menus to choose from and 2 portion sizes for most meals but beware- small meals are large and large are huge!  Very reasonably priced. Cost €100 inc drinks and starters for our individual group of 6.  High chair & kids menu with colouring crayons supplied and again portions are big for children. 1 meal would easily feed 2 under 8's.  Tip- all cocktails 2 for 1 earlier in the evening inc kids ones.

Good portions of delicious food. Waitress named Cathy was more than helpful to sort out food for my daughter who has coeliac disease.. The head chef also has the same condition so understands fully. A great place to eat if you need to have gluten free options. Staff were all friendly and helpful, all greeted you with a smile.

An American menu and an Italian menu, clearly not everything is fresh but it's still great food! The drinks are good with variety but the cocktails need work, they just look like a poor attempt at a cocktail. A little training would go a long way there. The staff are all friendly and know what there doing quite bubbly and chatty! However one small thing i would say, we were sat down buy a young ish lad with brown/blonde hair he was British. He swaggered over strutting around he looked like he cared more about his appearance and being noticed than actually doing his job which was sitting people down. Which again i would say needs improving. People waiting at the door to take a seat is great but no one was acknowledged before being sat down. A simple ""hi I'll be with you in a minute or just eating your table ready now"" goes a long way. All in all though I would return. The food and staff are good!",POSITIVE,0.9713292121887207

Around our hotel heard a number of people chatting Fat Mamas so think it generally goes down well with families as a good place to eat out at.",POSITIVE,0.9990850687026978

When I visited Paphos this year I went to have my favourite meal once again but unfortunately this time it was an absolute disappointment!!! The meat was boiled not cooked, had the smell and taste of raw meat and the sauce was a disaster. It was tasteless and meaningless. After a worthless attempt to have my meal I paid for it and informed tha waitress about the matter. The only response that I got was that she would mention it to the kitchen. That was all. No further response or attempt to solve the matter. I am so frustrated with their lack of professionalism. They lost a loyal, over the years customer with his friends for ever. I know that they run a successful business and 4-5 persons per year will do no much difference for their income but if they keep on serving such a poor quality of food they will end up closing at some point.",NEGATIVE,0.9997487664222717

When we arrived, we had to wait a while to be seated but people behind us (party of 10) jumped the queue and the staff happily showed them to their seats. We had also booked in advance but just waited patiently. Once seated, we had to wait a long time before receiving a menu and then again for our food. It did not come altogether, in fact 3 of us got our food first and 2 ten minutes after. Also the fries did not arrive with the meal. As per previous reviews, the food in huge in quantity but certainly lacked taste/flavour. There were customers who came after us but were served before us. As it was my birthday - a birthday song was sung, but two of my boys were not at the table at the time so that was a missed opportunity.

The portions are massive but our waitress was really accommodating when I asked to share a meal with my daughter and it arrived at the table already split on to two plates. There is a good atmosphere and singers and dancers perform popular songs every few minutes which was a really fun touch!

The second time wasn't a good experience and therefore I'm reluctant to give any more than 3 out of 5. On the second occasion my husband and I were shown to our seats by a friendly waiter and after only a few minutes our orders were taken. So far so good. Then it all seemed to go a bit downhill...my husband's enchiladas arrived (by a young waiter who just plonked the incredibly hot plate down in the middle of the table and then walked off forcing my husband to have to pick up the plate using a napkin to actually get it in front of him) and my fajitas did not! I waited 10 minutes and then mentioned this to a pleasant young waitress who went to sort out the problem. Apparently they'd gone to a different table so by the time I actually received my meal my husband had almost finished his. The waitress then came over to apologise and we were offered a free drink each. We were happy with this as mistakes do happen (and they were incredibly busy after all) and otherwise the food was very tasty and good value for money.

However what I got was completely unexpected. The seating was fast. The place looked busy and yet we were seated within a minute. Once we sat down we ordered and the food was with us promptly despite their 25min wait time they stressed. The staff were also smiley and helpful for members of my party in food selection. The portions were large and the food was cheap, cannot complain about the dining in any way in regards to taste, quality or price.    What I did take exception to was the entertainment. It was incredibly loud. I know this is a family place and there is live dancing and music but the music is loud and relentless. My party were just trying to chat and we were getting blasted by ABBA, lord knows how those people next to the speakers coped; we were across the room and it was still bad. Whilst this would only be a small problem if it was infrequent it kept happening! Once a song died down we would be blasted with another, at least split them up in ten minute increments to make it a bit more bearable. The lights were also turned off and we were treated to some lacklustre fire dancing all whilst im trying to have a conversation whilst putting food to my mouth. Towards the end of the meal I was developing a headache; something I should never get at an restaurant!    Overall I found it to be a fantastic place for food, portions were big and the cost small. However I felt the environment let it down, but may be it is just because my culture doesn't endulge in that sort of dining entertainment.",NEGATIVE,0.9574981927871704

We arrived just before 7 and got a seat straight away. The waitress told us it was happy hour and 2 for 1 on cocktails so we got 2 cocktails each with plenty of umbrellas and sparklers etc!  The food was better then I expected we both ordered from the mexican menu and it was very good. The kids menu was also good.  The children were very well looked after with menus to colour in and the staff made a fuss of them.  Every so often the dancing girls would come out and do a routine. They were good and my daughter loved seeing the costumes which were different overtime. A bit later the characters ""Fat Mama"" and Cowboy Willy"" came out and the children could meet them and have their photo taken with them (no charge). There was also a lady doing face paints and glitter tattoos (you had to pay for these).  The staff were great, we were not rushed at all even though there were people queuing for tables later on.

The portions from the main menu are big eg Ribs. The kids amusement area kind of did not work so the kids felt the 1 Euro machines are a bit of a scam. Given the food and service was poor, the positive and its a big positive is that the Management gave us a free main course and 10% off so they know how to solve issues without fuss.

Simply there for the food and drink and tasted amazing + portions very large. Guy sitting next to me had the biggest burger ever...must have been good as he consumed the lot. Pretty good value also.

We went early, before 7pm, as it gets very busy and we hadn't booked. We got a table straight away.  Starters of garlic bread and nachos to share. One portion of each was more than enough for four to share.  My daughter and I shared Mexican Fajitas, and were able to order extra wraps. I can definitely recommend them. Enough for two of us but if you're feeling very hungry one person could eat the lot, delicious! My husband ordered a 'small' rack of ribs and had plenty. He would never have managed the large portion by himself!  My son's pizza was the only disappointment, if you're after pizza visit the Italian Pizza restaurant further up the road. They really specialise so, as you would expect, their pizzas are excellent.  The food arrives very quickly and although we didn't feel rushed we did get the impression that they wanted us out quickly so that they could get the next customs in.

The food was good - I had a lovely pizza and there were good veggie options available (huzzah!) and there was a lively atmosphere (lots of singing, ""Mama"" and ""Willy"", and nail art/airbrushing etc) - this would have resulted in a high star rating. However, it took an hour and a half for our food to arrive. We didn't really notice to start with as we were enjoying our own company and the entertainment (and weren't interrupted for repeated drinks orders :()so we didn't kick up a fuss. We were given a free beer to make up for it when we were (eventually!) told that our order had been lost (and not that the kitchen was backed up).

1379,1379,Jfrank93,46,Average,2,27/07/2016,"I am very surprised to see the popularity of this restaurant and the only reason I can think of is because British tourists can relate to the Americanized atmosphere and menu. There are several more traditional restaurants along this strip whereby you have excellent service, great food and know you are contributing towards local families. Now, the main reason I have taken to write this review was seeing a response to a customer giving a critical review on the fat mama's Facebook page. The response from the restaurant was unprofessional, rude and will eventually spell their demise.  Me and my partner are a young couple who visited this restaurant last week purely because of its supposed popularity. After having queued up we were stood waiting for 5 minutes until I had to actually ask a member of staff whether we could be seated to which they took us to a table. They had recognized our presence prior to this so we were confused why we were not acknowledged. Upon being seated we were served promptly whereby we ordered two cokes and a bottle of wine. The cokes were delivered quickly but it tasted very much like unbranded coca cola so we left them. The wine also had the old label ripped off and a ""Fat Mama's"" label glued on over the top which gave no indication as to what wine it actually was because I refuse to believe the restaurant produces its own wine. We ordered our food and it was average, i would compare it to a chain such as Sizzling Pubs or Fayre and Square - there was no authenticity or care.  There was entertainment, British entertainment by girls who were again, average performers. Although I will say that it was a nice touch to have entertainment. If you come on holiday to visit a chain restaurant such as the aforementioned then this place is perfect for you. If you prefer good service with free bread, fruit and good wine, then walk a little further down the strip.",NEGATIVE,0.9872891902923584

Got the feeling they needed to turn the table round for a later booking.  That being said, staff were attentive and the food was good and plentiful and hot.  Ordered full ribs and only just finished it.  Some girls came out singing, which was a bit awkward but added a bit of fun.  The staff dressed in Cowboy Willy and Fat Mamma costumes were fun for little ones but looked dated.

I ordered the cheese garlic bread for starters which was really tasty and served in a bowl (4 large slices). This starter would easily satisfy two people. I also ordered a small portion of ribs but could only eat 1/3 of them. They would be considered a large portion anywhere else.

There is so much to choose from (they have 2 menus) ranging from Italian/Mexican/American/grilled dishes. They do also give you the option to choose whether you want the smaller or larger portion - the small portion is still more than enough!    Every 15-30 mins or so, the entertainers come out and sing/dance and at 9pm they put on a little 'cabaret' show which won't blow you away but is entertaining nonetheless.    Unfortunately, at the moment there is a lot of roadworks going on along the road which ruins the look and feel of the area.

I couldn't decide between the garlic bread and bbq chicken wings so I shared with one of my friends. This consisted of 4 large and soft garlic bread pieces and 8-10 wings with 2 large dips (BBQ and a chilli tomato).  I ordered a spicy burger which came with salad and fries. My friends ordered ribs (small) - the portion was equivalent to a full rack back in england. I finished my massive portion, my friends left with doggy boxes. I couldn't resist the desert menu. I got the dark chocolate cake slice which was served with a scoop of ice cream and cream, drizzled in chocolate. The cake was triple a standard size, it was moist and so tasty. There was a little show, with Irish dancing, a bit of Beyonce etc. Not really my thing, but hey! There were birthdays and anniversaries, a group of staff arrived at said tables singing happy birthday etc and presenting a free drink.

The drinks and food menu is good with very much a wide variety on offer.    The restaurant is always busy and popular and there is enough staff to cope during busy times.    Every so often the music will come on and the dancing girls will come out to entertain everyone which is great.    However I contacted the restaurant prior to my visit to arrange something special for our last evening in Paphos for my girlfriend.    I wanted to propose and make it special as I had heard the restaurant can do that.  Well they forgot and I ended up going back to the hotel and catching sunset on the veranda.  It was very romantic but I had planned this for a long time and obviously I couldn't get a spare minute to have a quiet word as my girlfriend was there.

But you don't go there just for the food. You go for the crazy and chaotic atmosphere, the excellent seemingly spontaneous entertainment and to marvel at the sheer number of birthdays that are celebrated. When you arrive, be sure to tell the staff that one of your group or family is celebrating a birthday. The fact that is's not true is part of the fun. At some point in the evening, a troupe of staff will arrive at your table singing happy birthday and generally behaving as it were true.

In fairness, it does seem to enjoy a good reputation, so our cautious review might say more about us than it does the restaurant.    The menu is extensive and looks amazing, but the food wasn't quite as appetising as the photos and description.    My wife had a cocktail (sex on the beach) which seemed to have been coloured by using Vimto. She hates Vimto so that wasn't best ever.    There was regular impromptu entertainment by singing girls. Not the best voices and it just seemed like cheap, tacky entertainment, geared up to drag in the typical Brit abroad.    The atmosphere was loud, OTT celebration for the sake of it.

Many meals are available in large or small sizes - even the small is equal to any other restaurant meal size; the large is enough for any normal human!  But size isn't everything (though it is important); the food was great as well. Fantastic steaks, gorgeous burgers and the Fajitas were every bit as good as mine!

The mains came out in good time, and although some elements were okay, it would appear that fat mamas favour quantity over quality. We left shortly after the full ""cabaret"" show started (as any conversation would be written off). It is also worthwhile to note that the waiters/waitresses took it upon them to help themselves to a tip before giving us any change (leaving us hanging a good ten minutes prior I might add..Maybe in some hope we that would just leave?).

Even if the restaurant was fully booked we had fast serve and all the waiters were polite. We had burgers (my husband, me and my son) and my daughter had chicken with cheese. May be this is the best burger I ever had. Great, great, great. All of us loved it. Every half an hour there is a small show performing by the waiters with different theme every time.

I went past there almost everyday of my one week stay in Paphos and it was the same entertainment, same songs being sang, same jokes being told and if you want a customer to return I don't think they would wish to see the same entertainment.

Service is good & friendly, every night seemed to be someones birthday/hen night/wedding/anniversary etc as we past this place alot to regularly hearing people being serinaded by the entertainment , also they have a nightly visit from Big Willy & Fat Mamma (basically again the entertainment dressed up as these hudge characters who lot's of guest would have there photo's taken with). Good for pulling the punters if you like that kind of thing/s.

It was so overloaded I sent it back and I have only once ever sent food back and that was because the meat was burnt! My grandson had the same problem and ate just one slice of his pizza. I felt so sickly the waitress asked if she could get me something to settle my stomach and she would see about doing something on the bill. Had water, my grandson was still hungry I'd lost my appetite so we left. Two meals sent back no discount on bill feeling sickly so from afar entertainment looked great up close food was awful, no management staff came to see if could replace grandsons food, a popular place but not sure given all we saw that it's a place people go back to.

We ate here twice during our stay - the first time we sat right near the entrance where the dancers perform at various points in the evening for customers celebrating birthdays, anniversaries etc. It was loud sat here and whilst I loved it if you're looking for a quiet place to sit then that's not it! However if you're after a quiet evening don't go to Fat Mama's! The second time we went we sat a bit further away so you don't have a great view of the performers it is a little quieter.  There's a good selection of food which was delicious and great value. The big portions are huge but with some of the meals you can opt for a smaller portion which is a good idea. Chocolate cake was amazing and cocktails are delicious. They do 2 for 1 deals at certain hours on drinks; the only downside to this is that they bring both drinks out together so if you don't drink the first one fast the other has warmed up nicely! The tables have a glass top so condensation from the drinks makes puddles of water all over, the waitress did wipe it now and then but it would be much easier if they just bought coasters.  Overall we really enjoyed it here that's why we went twice! Highly recommended.",POSITIVE,0.9926238059997559

Unfortunately it was extremely sweet, it was hard to eat it was that sweet, for a tomato pasta it's not something I would usually expect. My partner had ribs- again it was huge it was two rack of ribs with chips as a side- he also complained the BBQ sauce the ribs were covered in was far too sweet and made it less enjoyable! We would eat here again but make sure to try something sauce-less.    Whilst eating our food there were 3 girls and two boys marking through/reversing some sort of show routine? They were all in rehearsal clothes, didn't look like they were enjoying themselves (especially the guys) it was very awkward, they kept running the same dances because they would get moves wrong- one guy even got really angry he wasn't doing his lift right.

For the equivalent of 30 pence, I don't mind paying, but the restaurant must know you're gonna need to get the extras. No chance you;re fitting that much on 3 tortillas.    That, however, is my only grumble. Food was tasty.

1702,1702,Graham_Yates,39,Nothing special,3,28/08/2015,"Ate here on Sunday 23rd August and have done on previous visits to Paphos, no real complaints about the quality of the food, (although to be honest it does have a ""mass produced"" feel to it) it's actually the quantity I take issue with. Every time we've eaten here at least one of our party (on this visit it was two of us) has failed to finish our main course, and we're not alone judging by other plates we saw being cleared. Since we last visited about 8 years ago the restaurant does appear to have introduced a large/small portion size choice for customers on some dishes. Despite this, my Steak Diane, for example, was served on a huge plate, and whilst the steak was maybe 8oz at most, the rest of the plate area was filled with chips and salad!! My partner had chicken fajitas, where she was given 4 tortillas as part of the dish and then enough chicken fajita mix on a skillet to fill at least 8 to 10 tortillas (extra tortillas available at 40c each!!). My 11 year old had the ""small"" ribs which amounted to two full racks of ribs and a huge plate of chips (the ""large"" amounted to four racks apparently), and was actually apologetic that she couldn't finish more than one rack!!    All in all, while there was nothing wrong with the food as such (although I'd describe the quality as slightly above average at best), we couldn't help but feel it would be better to reduce portion sizes further and perhaps reduce the cost of each meal in line with that.    The amount of overall wastage from the restaurant must be huge, and you can't help but wonder what happens to it.    There is a rather cheesy ""cabaret"" show that you'll either love or loathe (we were neither here nor there about it to be honest ...but were not compelled to stay for all of it if that's any indication). There are also regular ""turns"" throughout the evening where a troupe of girls come out to sing/dance to a song to mark someone's birthday/anniversary etc., whilst a nice touch in some ways, these can actually be quite annoying as they are unannounced and the music is turned up loud for each one making it difficult to carry on whatever conversation you were having. One started as our waitress was taking our order and we hd to shout to make ourselves heard.    All in all, some might see it as a fun place, but for us, as the title says Fat Mama's/Cowboy Willy's is nothing special.",NEGATIVE,0.9976795315742493

There is nothing traditional Cypriot about Fat Mamas. Portions are massive, verging on madness! The food was good but nothing out of this world. The night was enjoyable enough, and we received a free glass of champagne as we were on our honeymoon which was a nice gesture    We planned to sit all night, enjoying the cabaret and having drinks, however we were so full we literally HAD to walk it off.    I wouldn't rush back, mainly because most of the food we were served is in our apartment fridge so we wouldn't need to, (they let you take home anything uneaten) but also because it was nothing that special, although a nice evening none the less.",POSITIVE,0.975352942943573

All the party enjoyed their food orders, for the children (6, 6, 4, and 1) the children's portions were extremely large - one between two would have been adequate. For adults unless a serious eater the small portions are more than sufficient.    This is a unique place. When restaurants nearby are quiet or even empty, Fat Mama's is usually always full and the evening is full on.    Not a place to go if you want a quite tete a tete in the evening but definitely an experience worth savouring.",POSITIVE,0.9994255304336548

It was brilliant we found a card saying ' buy 1 get 1 free on cocktails and mocktails between 6-7'. There drinks were amazing really tasty full of flavour. When ordering our food it came out 15-25 minutes after ordering which I think is brilliant because of the people that came in later started to order. The make your own pizza is brilliant its full of tasty food you can choose. That is what I had that evening. I also got a tattoo which was and airbrush spider under my wrist that's worked its way through 2 days undamaged. Our favourite part ( I'm speaking about my family and I) was the entertainment don't worry it's usual it's a little late personaly I think there short staffed.

The restaurant was full so there was a very brief wait for a table, so it's best to get there earlier rather than later but we didn't have to wait long at all.  There is a choice of an Italian or American menu which took a while to read but the choices were vast. I was unsure whether to order the small or Mama's portion. I went small and I'm so glad - it wasn't small at all rather regular and the large size is humungous!  The dancers and entertainment were very good and made the venue unique. It was the only meal we had where I felt so full (and I didn't finish it!) I could barely move afterwards.  Only downside was there were two things wrong with the bill - my 6 year old was charged for an adult's sized meal and there was another drink we did not have, but that aside it was a wonderful meal in a great restaurant.",POSITIVE,0.9971670508384705

Had wings to start and ribs to follow and both were very tasty, particularly the ribs which the portion of you will struggle to finish. Wife had a burger which was good and huge. Kids had pasta and pizza which was probably the worst choice and I'd say average at best.  Service was very good and all waiters/waitresses were polite and attentive.  Whilst eating they also have some very random entertainment and every 15 mins or so, a bunch of girls would burst into song and dance. Not something you'd pay to see but definitely adds to the atmosphere of the place and kids liked it.

The food comes in humongous portion sizes (so if you're not hungry, don't order a starter or possibly order a smaller amount.)  The entertainment was good on the first night however, we were seated under a speaker so we couldn't hear our selves speak at some points, so i'd recommend asking for a table away from a speaker if you don't want too much disturbance.  The second night that we went to this restaurant, both me and my mum ordered two different burgers, when they came the were loaded with cheese which wasn't supposed to be there, however we did the best we could but the cheese made the burger greasy and the meal that night tasted a little like a fast food restaurant like mcdonalds.

Starters - I had garlic prawns on toast which were delicious, only spoilt by the addition of a hair! I pointed this out to the waiter but little was said. My husband had chicken wings which he enjoyed. Unfortunately the main was very different. I had lasagne which had so much pasta and little sauce. The sauce was not very nice - bitty meat (pork I think) and chunky tomato. They pride themselves on large portions and it would have been better smaller with less pasta! They do offer smaller portions for some dishes but not lasagne. It is one of my favourite dishes and I was very disappointed. I didn't eat much of it at all.

There is always a queue to get in and it feels more like you are sitting in a show than a restaurant.    There is a wide choice across the two menus but I would say that the quality of food is average rather than anything special but the portions are large.    I had chicken Fahitas which were very bland and lacking in flavour until I asked for some chilli sauce to spice them up.

After 5 mins our main came again good sized portions just about made it through the massive burger and chips. We didn't have room for dessert but both left with a good baby!! With few largers and water bill was around 42euro which I think reasonable. All the time a mini dance show was on to entertain the customers which helped with the atmosphere within the restaurant.

We were ushered to a table outside near the entrance with no option as to where we wanted to sit.  We barely had the drink list when we were asked for our drinks order. I explained we weren't ready to order and the waitress left us. About 30 seconds later another waiter asked for our drinks order. I almost told him where to go but I thought I'd be polite and explained we weren't ready.  After we had time to peruse the menu and the bar list we ordered or drinks and food  The drinks arrived quickly.  When the food arrived it was hot.  My chilli was over spiced. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but spices need to be balanced. The rice was bland and tortilla cups had been dumped on the plate.  My wife and youngest daughter's meals were okay but my eldest daughter's pizza was full of herbs, so much so that she couldn't eat it.  When the waiters arrived to clear the table we were asked if we wanted to take my daughter's pizza away but we said no. I expected them to ask if it had been okay as there was almost the entire pizza left but they didn't appear bothered.    I got the bill and left.

The place was very busy but it felt very much like a fast food outlet, not a restaurant.  Despite every table being filled the food still only took about 10 minutes to reach the table, which some people may find to be a good thing but to me it just highlighted the poor quality of the food. There must have been over 20 staff at this place but again it just felt almost like we were on a production line rather than a feeling of being waited on.

When the food arrived there was far too much. My granddaughter wouldn't even try as there was so much. Half the portion sizes would be sufficient and possibly a cheaper price as well.

Entertainment is also supplied by the waiters / waitresses to add to an enjoyable evening. With Fat Mama and Cowboy Willie putting in an appearance around about 20:00 which is great for the kids.

We saw waiters buzzing about with plates piled high with food and as we hadn't eaten since breakfast in the UK we licked our lips in anticipation. Ordered a large portion of ribs to share which were nice but as some of the posters' on here need to realise they are the same ones you can buy at most supermarkets in the UK. I had the 'cowboys portion' of fillet steak with hot sauce, fries and veg, the veg was discoloured the sauce was packet gravy with Tabasco in it. My wife had beef fajitas which was the same horrible veg of carrot & courgette batons sliced peppers and onions with chewy, sour chunks of sinewy beef. Add a couple of beers and 76€ is crazy money considering the lack of skill in the cooking and presentation.",NEGATIVE,0.9973859190940857

The food was fantastic and the portions are huge! I had the hot n spicy burger with added cheese and it was arguably one of the best burgers ive ever had! My husband had the large portion of ribs which was indeed LARGE! It came as 2.5 racks of ribs which were beautiful but he only managed yo eat half so be aware that the normal portions are mostly always enough to fill you!

To be honest I wish I had gone somewhere else. You def need to arrive early if you want to get a table and not wait. We arrived for 7.15 and got a table with out a problem, 30mins later there was a large queue of people waiting.  Menu is either Italian or American and portion control well there isnt any, if you come, I recommend not eating the whole of the day before you come.  The food itself is ok, we both had seabass which was adequate but expensive at 16 euros.  The main thing apart from the portion size that seems to sell the place are the staff who are either so over eager they are hyper or the girls who periodically come out in various costumes to mime to various tracks from Beyonce to Diana Ross which is odd when you are eating a meal. Give them their due, they do try had and I did feel sorry for them when the majority of people seemed more intent on eating their steak n chips rather than watching the performance.

The food portions are massive. Nacho starter to share is a meal on its own and you could fill up just on that.    I had fajitas, bruchetta, pizza and nachos over the two visits and there was no complaint about the quality of the food.    Fat Mamas provide cabaret entertainment throughout the evening consisting of a handful of dancers which was nice to watch during the meal.    It's one of the pricier restaurants in the area but that's balanced by quality and quantity of food.    My only negative comment is that I had vegetarian fajitas which was shown as an option next to chicken fajitas. When the bill came I was charged the same price for chicken fajitas even though all I had was vegetables. This is the only thing preventing me from giving this review 5 stars.

Not the cheapest place in the surroundings you can go, but you get what you pay for. Has live entertainment which while not the best calibre is a nice bonus. Only complaint is service, we were told by one waitress we good divide the bill by families, then the next, quite frankly, rather abruptly, told us we couldn't.

I also had a cocktail but it did not taste right , it tasted like the cream had started to go off.

We had bruschetta to share to start which was a big portion two large pieces each. Main course for my husband was veggie fahittas and I had the small portion of BBQ ribs, which I may say both portions were large. It's like all the restaurants are trying to compete by offering the biggest portions.. Which can be wasted if over faced.    Bottle beer was slightly expensive compared to other restaurants.    If we are completely honest my only real negative point and I do hope the management review this as we did complete the restaurant service questionnaire which was given to us by our waitress.  The bill showed the veggie fahittas to be charged the same price for meat ones, which is a bit cheeky allowing it was the veggie option and on checking the menu it's the only thing not priced.    So all you veggies please check this before you order/pay as this shouldn't be same as chicken/meat option. I would be interested for the management to explain the logic on this price.

The food was OK, big portions and you wont leave feeling hungry. Only problem was the starters, the starters are all meant for 4 people so if it is just you and a partner, you have to order 1 of the same starter between you?? We shared the ribs starter which was OK, not the best ribs I have ever had. Looked and tasted like they have been boiled in a weak BBQ sauce for a few hours and were too fatty, I thought good ribs were meant to be slow cooked, then BBQ'd and basted in a BBQ sauce??    The main courses were good, my wife had the fakitas which were nice and I had one the steaks - steak was cooked and seasoned well.    Furthermore, the cocktails tasted weak, seriously lacking in alcohol, my guess is that they only contained 1 shot of watered down alcohol. At 6 Euros each they are not expensive but were not worth the money. I also ordered a double vodka and lemonade which did not tatse like a double shot, I was re-assured there was about it certianly didnt taste like it.    The service was fantastic, even though ti was really busy, this could not be faulted. It didnt feel like we were rushed all evening.

The food is good if you like Pizza,steaks,ribs etc. If you come here for a traditional Cypriot meal you will be disappointed. This is about big portions and fun.    The Pizzas are superb as is the steak.    The entertainment is fun but is just that a bit of fun, don't expect anything earth shattering.

2046,2046,Kristina3302,2,Very disappointed.,2,31/08/2014,"I went with some friends to Fat Mama's last night. We have heard so much about this restaurant over the years so we decided to give it a try last night.  It was not too busy didnt have to wait more than 5 minutes to get a table.  The waiters were very busy and didn't have time to tell us about the menus. The waiter that took our drink order hardly looked at us, he was looking all around him, didn't listen to out orders and he was shouting to the other waiters while we were talking to him.  The girl that took the food orders was nice and polite  It didn't take long for the food to come. I had ordered veal marsala, a dish I have had before at other restaurants and I know how it should taste. My friends had steak and another veal dish.  The vegetables were fresh and perfectly cooked BUT here it comes. All the food was totally tasteless. The vegetables, the meat, the sauce etc tasted of absolutely nothing!!!! The veg, the meat and the sauce were cooked without any salt, pepper och spices. The sauce on the veal marsala was like a beige jelly like sauce, completely tasteless. I am not a fan of salt but I had to put so much on to get any taste of out the food at all. We all said exactly the same thing. It was so bland that it was like eating cardboard. We were very hungry and the waiters were busy so we ate the food anyhow. We did tell the waiter when she came to clear the table. She told us that it was too late to complain, fair enough. But then she carried on and on about how they can not cook with even salt and pepper as there are some people that can't eat salt and spicy food. She said thats why they have salt and pepper on the table so you can add flavor yourself!! I have never in my life had such completely tasteless food served to me in a restaurant before. The entertainment was very unprofessional, 3 or 4 young waiters dressed up in wigs etc running around for 2 minutes to music 3 or 4 times during the time we were there. All in all the experience was very disappointing. We will not go back.",NEGATIVE,0.998015284538269

At 7 pm this all changes (no booking, no half price cocktails etc). However, there were lots of birthdays in early too so we seemed to have the dancing girls coming out every 5 minutes to do a dance and then wish somebody a happy birthday. The children liked meeting and getting their photo with Fat Mama and whoever the other character is (sorry can't remember).    I loved my food. I had sea bass with a ginger sauce and I ordered it as it sounded a bit different to anything I had tried before and it really was delicious. My husband had rattlesnake steak which he enjoyed but didn't exactly rave about.    My youngest fell asleep as soon as we arrived and when she woke up was adamant that she was only going to have plain spaghetti, something on every menu in paphos except Fat Mama's, but they were happy to do this for her and brought it quickly.    I am glad we went as it had been recommended to us and it was something a bit different.

I can't really count the number of time two dancers came out to dance to a well known song followed by a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' to one of the customers in the space of a couple of hours, but it was great fun and a highlight of our holiday.    The food was American/Italian and it was great, if I'm being honest, it was one of the best steaks I've ever tasted. The staff were extremely helpful and the service was speedy and we weren't rushed which was an extra bonus.    There's also the 'Compliments to the Chef' trick - once you've finished your meal, if you say 'compliments to the chef' to your waiter, when they are taking all the empty plates away they shout in the kitchen at the top of their voices 'COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF FROM TABLE XX' to which the kitchen replies 'YES CHEF!' which we found highly entertaining and of great comedy value.

The food was mediocre and the service was terrible. I asked for a vodka and coke but just got a coke. When I mentioned this to the waitress she didn't seem to be interested. They had some awful woman pretending she could sing and to be honest she was appalling! The dancers weren't much better. It's also not good value for money and no where near as Gustoso.

However, almost 10 minutes later no-ome had even made eye contact. Once our server did come to the table service was as quick as it could be given how busy it was.

Unfriendly, abrupt and unapologetic.  Taking away drinks that we hadn't finished. Almost knocking one of our guests from his chair without any signs of an apology, plus a few other small incidents. By the way, they won't let you split the bill if your in a party which means someone has to sit there and work it all out if your all chipping in.

Yes the portions can be on the large side but overall the food is expertly cooked whether it be Italian, burghers or ribs. The ribs are to die for & having seen the mains portion I can't imagine what animal it's from, they are massive & I learnt the first time that the starter ribs are more than adequate. The meat just falls away & is gorgeous.    This year we noticed that instead of every half hour or so when the waitresses come out & sing pop songs they were coming out in different costumes about every 15 minutes or so. This made it feel more of an entertainment place to eat rather than a restaurant with occasional entertainment. Fat Mama & cowboy Willy appear out front to pose for photos with the children (& adults if the mood takes you) which just adds a little bit more fun to the whole experience.    If you go to Pathos for a holiday, you really must give Fat Mamas a try, you wont be disappointed & if you are like us it will become a regular place to go when in Pathos.",POSITIVE,0.9909071922302246

Fat Mama's is a classic burger, wings, ribs, lasagne, pizza, chips, nachos, garlic bread sort of place where the emphasis is on daftness, good times and ridiculously gigantic portions. (If you are low carbing or want to eat some green vegetables you might want to skip the rest of this review.)    But here's the thing - the food is surprisingly good. And I mean really good.    Fat Mama's has taken a formula and stuck with it. It works really well - like a well oiled machine and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if this is the most profitable restaurant in the whole of Paphos.    So if you have kids under the age of 18 this is the place to take them, relax and let the staff do the entertaining. You should definitely book in advance if you don't want to queue and come 8.30 pm there are always queues.    Top tip - book before 7pm.

After a week of eating delicious, fresh, delicious Cypriot food we were so disappointed to be presented with what we ate here. We had been to Laona the night before which made this experience even worse as we'd had our best meal ever in Cyprus there. Massive portions of tasteless, greasy junk food; sauce in plastic pots; even the cokes we ordered tasted watered down. Meanwhile, there were wasps everywhere, some weird 'entertainment' and kids on arcade machines. I think it's the sort of place you go on holiday if you don't like 'foreign' food or if your kids can only behave if they're being constantly stimulated by games, toys and colouring crayons.    The staff were ok but you don't get the same server throughout so they don't know where you're at; at one point our plates had barely touched the table and we were asked if we wanted to give our compliments to the chef!    By the time we left they were queuing at the entrance to get in whilst some of the great tavernas either side remained empty.

The ribs had been boiled to within a inch of their life and were swimming in a weird sweet sauce and whilst the fajitas were almost passable they nowhere near justified their 17 euro price tag.    This is also the first restaurant where a waiter has come to us before we have tasted a bite to say ""foods good yes, I'll pass on your compliments to the chef"" I'm not sure if he was joking....

You have to spare a thought for the Cypriot neighbours looking across from their empty premises at Fat Mama's bursting with people at 7pm.  They do what they do very well. Good Ribs (I do prefer the membrane to be removed from my ribs but otherwise very good). Burger was good although why I had to order an adults one for my 6 year old is a mystery to me (no burger on kids menu)  Unless you are a trucker don't bother with the large portion of ribs (2 and a half racks of baby backs!)  Overall very pleased. Kids enjoyed the place.,POSITIVE,0.9993588328361511

On the way the taxi guy said it was really nice. We were on an all inclusive holiday and wanted a break from it. For starter me and my partner had the sharing meat platter. Included nachos, chicken wings, ribs, potato skins. The ribs just fell off the bone. There were amazing. The platter was huge so please bare this in mind. For main my partner had the small ribs and fries and I had the BBQ burger with fries. The ribs wasn't a small portion I would have called it large but still amazing as the starter. The burger was out of this world marinated in a BBQ sauce. If you can't eat all your food you can take away which we did as we were so full. The staff and dancers as entertainment were really good.

Two menu's are provided, one is Italian, the other American style. The portions were enormous and all the food was very tasty from both menus. Really can't fault the place although service was a tad slow on the very busy final night that we came. Every now and then, proceedings are broken up with dancing and singing and the place is a fun place to be.    Just wished I'd tried the steak option here instead of the Farm House Tavern just down the road! Anyway, we both liked it and will certainly visit again when visiting Paphos in future.

I had a half portion of pasta and couldn't eat that, sizes too big which can be off putting!

Now the food...the food is brilliant, perfectly cooked steaks and yummy. However portioms are absolutely massive, share a starter, and there is no need to have the larger portions...trust me on that.    Only suggestions are to have one menu...having 2 is confusing...give me one menu and let me work through it, also make the portions smaller and then you can reduce the price, as the bill was a bit mind blowing.

The entertainment was good fun, primarily a dance group with a bit of singing yet they put on a good show in limited space. Now we come to the food not one but two large menus, large being the operative word when we talk about portions size as well. I foolishly went for a large steak, didn't need it small would have been fine and my daughter had the fudge cake, that took three of us to eat it.

The menu is rather limited, Tex mex or Italian and the prices for what I find to be average food is very expensive. I think its about €10 for a pizza. It also must be one of the only places in Cyprus that does not sell keo beer just Leon, which is like the Cypriot cheaper alternative, only thing is here it isn't any cheaper. I see why the place appeals to families as they have people dressed up and 'entertainement' etc but I have to say both myself and my husband who where out for a nice early evening meal found the whole set up rather tacky! The stafd who dealt with hs where very nice but I fail to see how the place gets so many people on.

We spend on average 6 weeks a year in Paphos and have done for the last 11 years.    I have always been a fan and advocate of FM's but on our recent visit we felt that standards had slipped.    The portions are still good...but not as large as they use to be. But I must admit that the introduction of 'half portions' a couple of years ago was a master stroke.    On one recent visit we ordered a side of chips which would normally be enough for 2 or 3 people to share but now it's just a small to average size portion.    And for the first time ever we had to send food back! A basic pasta dish that my wife normally raves about was swimming in water and grease. The other meals were very average but we put it down to eating later than usual. We waited nearly an hour for a table (which was fine as we knew it was busy) but 95% of the people in there were just sat with an empty table waiting for the show. So perhaps the kitchen were winding down.    Still a great restaurant and the show and entertainment is quirky and great fun.

2131,2131,DominicL697,7,Ok if you are hungry.,3,25/06/2014,"We've been going to Cyprus for the last 8 years, and initially Fat Mama's was a must stop place. However, over time we have seen the quality of food deterioriate, and we won't be going again. We have also noticed that the queues that used to form no longer do so, so we are obviously not alone in our findings.    Initially, you will be amazed at the size of the portions. The problem is, with a few exceptions, most of the dishes are fairly bland and tasteless. So while you may well get a lot of lasagne, if it doesn't taste very nice, its a bit irrelevent. Now, the ribs are delicious, and if you like ribs you will certainly be in your element, but a lot of the other dishes are just not worth the calories.    With regards to the entertainment, it is really annoying. If you have ever been in Frankie and Bennies when they have a birthday on, then magnify that by 4. Plus, if you are unlucky, they may also pick you as the recipient, whether its your birthday or not. You get a free cocktail for putting up with it, but I would have preferred they just left us alone when it happened to us. If you have never been before then the entertainment probably won't seem to bad, but repeated visits reveal that the entertainment is remarkly formulaic, and doesn't change from evening to evening.

One venue, two menu's. As you would expect, Italian food if you are a pasta lover or Tex-mex, Cowboy Willie style if you are a burger and steak lover. and on both menu's you can choose the size of your portion, with Mama's being a fair size, but a Cowboy Willie portion if you want to skip breakfast the next day. Steaks are always a must . . . .cooked to perfection every time by the Chef's who LOVE to be complimented if you enjoy their food. just ask the Waiter to send your compliments to the Chef ;-). And then there's the floor show each night as well as the birthday, anniversary and party celebrations presented by the entertainment team with a Mama's complimentary cocktail, complete with sparklers . . . . And of course for the younger people with you, as well as those of us who choose never to grow up even if we cancan't prevent growing old, you can get to meet and have your photo taken with the happy couple themselves.

We waited a while to get into the restaurant, but I know this is the norm, we were eventually seated and again waited a while to order our drinks, which we found expensive, we live in Paphos and have had much cheaper drinks in restaurants. The waitress was a bit off hand when we ordered our food, was a busy night. We again waited a while for it to be delivered.  The food arrived and my wife who had ordered a chicken dish, asked for the vegetables for her meal, she was told it only came with coleslaw, very poor. The food was ok but nothing special. The entertainment does not in my opinion justify the prices charged at this restaurant. I will not be going again for a long time no matter how popular others find it.

It is great fun, the staff are cheerful and welcoming. Fat mama and willy make an appearance, last week we were with my 3 young grandchildren and two of them are nervous of characters, so we just waved them away as they got near, they immediately got the message and waved to us from across the room. The 3 grandchildren loved dancing by our table when the dancing girls came out, and I must say that we joined in. Then if you say to your waiter or waitress 'compliments to the chef' they shout it out, the kitchen staff all shout back 'thank you'. The food probably isn't the best in the world, it is burgers, ribs, chicken etc. But it is fine. In my opinion go as much for the atmosphere as the food. I can imagine height of season the queue can be long, but we have never queued as we always try to find a time when we don't have too. I.e. Because we had the children with us we ate early at just after 6 p.m., so not only was there no queuing but also it was 10% off between 5 - 7 p.m. I would recommend this restaurant to families, and groups of friends.

Smaller eaters wil be pleased that for many dishes (pasta etc) you can get a small portion, which I can tell you will not leave many people wanting more.  The staff tends to entertain the eaters with song and dance during the evening and there is face apinting for the kids. The food is typically Italian and Tex-Mex (Ribs, fajitas, barbecue, pasta, pizza etc..).

Sure they are big portions, but some of them taste incredibly bland. I did like the ribs, but the pasta dishes just don't have any flavour at all. I should stress that I've been on more than one occasion. Several over the years in fact. Each time I've been a little bit more disappointed.    One final thing, you may have to put up with them singing an annoying birthday song to somebody. They do this every evening, at more or less the same time.

Was with my wife and 2 sons 17 & 12. Place always looked busy so we thought we would give it a try, but certainly won't be going back.    FOOD.    What we ate was ok, had better but also had worse, but the portions were just stupid. My 12 year old son likes his ribs, so ordered a ""small"" serving of them .... The plate was so crammed with ribs when it arrived, the 4 of us could easily have struggled to eat it. Now some may say that's a good thing, but for a 12 year old kid it was pathetic and wasteful, NOT impressive as we expect was the aim of the restaurant. I consider myself quite a big eater, but I just felt full and lost my appetite as soon as our food arrived because it was all just too much, Desperate Dan would have struggled.    ENTERTAINMENT.    Where do I start... Absolutely awful. Sporadic 5 minute spells of girls miming and prancing around (all out of sync with each other) to spice girls tracks being played extremely loudly through the house PA system. It was so loud we had to shout at each other across our table of 4 !!!! Then waiters joined in and we had a poorly rehearsed sketch from a musical or pantomime ?? The waiter, who was miming to another deafening ditty through the PA, looked like he'd rather be anywhere but there. It really was POOR POOR POOR.

On the night we went in it was about two thirds full, so we stood at the front entrance (as instructed on the board), and waited to be seated. Unlike Gustoso up the road who just leave you standing at the entrance, the staff at Fat Mama's came to acknowledge us immediately and found us a table of our choice.    There were two extensive menu's available with a huge array of various meat dishes....and the choice of a 'standard' portion or a 'Fat Mama's' portion! My partner went for a steak and I opted for Hunter's chicken, and both meals were of excellent quality, with the 'standard' portion being plenty. We had cocktails to accompany our meal here, and the cocktails were the best that we had during our holiday in Paphos.    The entertainment was what it was, and I can understand why some people have called it cheesy or whatever....three girls dancing to Spice Girls songs might not be to everyone's liking! But as we were sat at the far side of the restaurant we didn't find it to be too intrusive,    I'd highly recommend this place if you're a fan of mouth watering meat dishes....and if you're not keen on the 'cabaret' then ask for a table at the far side!",POSITIVE,0.9990642666816711

Yes its a steak house and not a typical Greek style restaurant but we knew that before we went in. The prices are a bit more expensive but the quality and size of the portions reflect this. You can choose from a standard size or go for the Fat Mama's which is huge. The ribs just fall off the bone and the steaks were cooked just how we wanted them.  They lay on some entertainment every night usually consisting off 3 dancers which makes a change from listening to Greek music every night.

Not much has changed over the years - service is good, food is OK, prices reasonable and the entertainment gives a good atmosphere, Taken altogether this makes for an enjoyable experience    We are confirmed Fat Mama's fans, but we feel that to some extent the restaurant lives on its past glories. It has seen a steady decline in its TA ranking, reflecting a rather stale format. One thing it should do, we think, is to focus on the food - generally this is good, but our pizzas were cold by the time we were half way through which detracts from the enjoyment, however flavoursome. The entertainment too needs a revamp - it is good to have, but it needs to change and improve    There are lots of good things about this restaurant, for example the welcome, the service and general food quality, so we are not looking for major change - a tweak or 2 here and there would put it back to where it once was",NEGATIVE,0.9904380440711975

On arrival we waited for a table which to be fair was a pretty quick considering it was peak times around 8pm however when we got to our table which was suppose to be for 9 people we was sat at a table for six with added chairs after trying to squeeze on and staff trying to squeeze 3 and half a persons placemats on one tiny table meant for 2 we said we would leave as we were all sitting on top of each one member of group backed into a tree after they then moved us to a more suitable table made for 9 which was free .... Why they put us on that tiny table in the first place I don't know? Maybe as they wanted to squeeze as many big tables as possible! We was then told we couldn't split bills however they could give us a calculator after to work it out didn't find this very accommodating or welcoming especially after already been squeezed on to a table and had to be moved. We didn't end up eating there as we wasn't made to feel welcome or as our custom was valued some staff were friendly however others were clearly rushed of there feet through no fault of there own maybe they were under staffed. I marked the food despise not eating as after looking at the menu I liked that smaller portions were offered for smaller appetites! Entertainment looked good for children however felt it was very similar to TGI Fridays but with not so good service. Shame as we was looking forward to trying there after seeing the crowds and seeing it on the Internet but would rather eat down the road where our custom was valued, food cheaper, drinks half price and a more personal touch to our meal. Not the worst restraint I'm sure however feel that maybe fat mamas are thinking of quantity of customers over quality of service!",NEGATIVE,0.9987364411354065

My daughter and i had the fajitas, my husband and dad had the chilli, my mum had the canaloni. All the mains were delicious.

We ate here on our last day in Paphos around 5pm when there were very few people there, as we wanted to see what all the fuss was about. It wasn't anything special to be perfectly honest. Steak was cooked well but accompanying vegetables were cold and greasy. We ordered the small portion which was more than enough for us so wouldn't want to think what this larger portions are like.

When you look at Fat Mama's you will see a restaurant that is full almost every night from March when it opens until Halloween when it closes.    It's not fine dining, but then it doesn't pretend to be. What it is, is a good restaurant, serving excellent food, good portions (read big) and at very reasonable prices.    In between serving you, some of the girls and boys put on mini-shows that keep people entertained throughout the night. if it's your birthday, anniversary, wedding or any other special event, then you will also be honoured.

The staff was of very good standard, most languages spoken, and the surprising entertainment was great. The manager himself Mr Alex, very active in all fields, welcomes people that the entrance and places them at the tables giving the personal touch to the dining procedure. The double menu gives the customer a wide variety of choices and I must say that the dishes were the biggest I have seen in any restaurant around Paphos. The restaurant was sparkling clean in spite the busy evening. The fact that people wait in a queue to be seated shows very well how successful the restaurant is, a criterion for any foreign visitor who doesn't really know where to go in order to dine out.

The service was great. Attentive staff but not in your face. Food was quick. The only downside for us was the entertainment. Music plays then all of a sudden a song comes on, very loud & a group of people come out dressed up, perform a dance & then go to a table for a happy birthday song. This happened 4 times when we were there & kind of interrupted our nice, quiet meal out - annoying for us but may not be for others & understand it just might have been a busy birthday night!

There were no other sides provided (coleslaw or peas would have been nice). The hunters chicken was on a plate that was so hot the cheese was actually stuck to the plate surrounded by grease.

I have to say that it didn't sound like the usual type of restaurant that we would visit, but we decided to have a look.    We arrived at about 730pm, and already a queue was forming outside. Don't let that put you off though as the turnover of people is such that there is never much of a wait from what we could see.    The staff were courteous, professional and fun. There was always some form of interaction going on, whether it be celebrating a birthday, wedding anniversary or simply the excellent entertainment that the staff were putting on.    The food was good, not great, but was perfect for what the place is. It doesn't pretend to be high end fine dining, but the selection of sharing starters such as nachos, ribs etc are perfect for this environment.    We started with nachos to share, we had a steak and enchiladas as main (small portion - believe me it's all you need)    We had mojitos Pre dinner and a bottle of Pinot Grigio with dinner. We finished our wine watching the cabaret show that the staff put on.    We had a really fun, enjoyable evening. The food, entertainment and ambience is pitched perfectly and our bill came to €65.

After day 2 of our holiday, enticed by queues and the wonderful cabaret, I decided to try Fat Mamma's. I am so very glad that I did. The food has been consistently excellent, mouth watering lay tasty steaks, well cooked vegetables, crist fries, wonderful staff who genuinely care and are discretely attentive. Every dish that my partner and I have tried during the last 10 visits has been well cooked, well presented and very tasty, on every visit we both struggled to choose which wonderful dish to try next. Deserts are good, starters are huge and the mains (even small portions) are large. I heartily recommend Fat Mamma's, it is not typically Cypriot, sorry other local eateries, the quality here is excellent.  Others have mentioned that the entertainment is tacky and amateurish, I disagree, the waiters make an effort and work hard to provide a varied and enjoyable entertainment every night.

Menu is vast and very 'American' in style and portion size. Not bad value but average quality food at best. Entertainment is awful.

The ""small"" portions are great value at around 5 euros, and are really enough. That makes this place very good value. I can't imagine how anyone manages the ""Mama's"" portions. The service is efficient and friendly. The ""cabaret"" song and dance acts are amusing enough at first but to be honest they pale after a bit and certainly don't encourage you to linger over your food and drink. While they're going on you can't really hear yourself talk.

In the past it has proved to be a great night out with good food and good entertainment. This time, however, we left feeling a little disappointed with the food and the entertainment.    There is a great deal in the two menus and the portions are not for dieters! We chose from both menus and the Nachos went down very well. The potato skins on the other hand were a little undercooked and there were a couple of us left eating raw potato. The mains were fine, and the ribs were devoured in record time by my son!    The staff put on a variety of 'entertainments' for the customers during the evening. There is a musical accompaniment to any birthday or anniversary 'surprise' which goes down well, although they weren't as good as a couple of years ago. Perhaps the novelty has worn off. We then had the 'Cabaret' which again didn't seem to be as good as it has been.    To be fair to all at the establishment, it might be down to the fact that it was early season, or that I am getting too old for this type of evening entertainment!

2409,2409,Rockyroscoe,37,Heavy dose of cheese ... but love it!,5,06/04/2013,"Just visited Fat Mama's with my wife and two kids after it was recommended by someone. Where do i start? Firstly this is definitely a place which is aimed at families, everyone is really friendly and you are immediately made to feel very welcome.    I'll talk about the food and the service later but wanted to spend sometime telling you about the entertainment? it was a mix of a working mans Disney show meets Strictly Come Dancing meets Britains Got Talent.    Part one - one of the dancers gave a couple of songs ... pretty good so far.  Part two - enter Woody and Fat Mama the 'Disneyesque' character to entertain the kids (and the parents). The outfits are weren't as polished as you see in Disney, but what they lacked in refined foam features, they made up in enthusiasm and warmness. Stopping at every table for pictures.  Part three - the main act. After a Caberet style entrance complete with show feathers they moved into an eclectic mix of dance styles and the three beautiful girls were joined by two male dancers who looked more like victims than part of the show. C'mon guys ... you are dancing with beautiful girls - relax and enjoy it! That said one of them does a convincing Dancing on Ice headbanger routine - impressive!    Show over so let me tell you about the food and service. As everyone has said the portions are huge and the food great quality - couldn't fault it. The service was first class and everyone was always happy to help.    VERDICT: Food, service and atmosphere get 5 stars and i would recommend it to anyone.

The portions are very big but there is a smaller option which I would recommend unless your super hungry, then the large ribs should be your choice. Entertainment is outstanding live shows every night with extras, i.e birthday dances and romantic occasions throughout the night. Dancers are very professional and the shows are well thought of, I never left unsatisfied. All staff members are ultra friendly and customer service is exceptional.

The restaurant has two menus that you can mix and match, one of which is Italian and the other is American. The potato skins that we had for starters were very tasty. The veggie options were a little limited, which has perhaps unfairly brought my rating down (there was little for me to chose from) and for the main meal I had a pizza with feta cheese and onions. It was nice, good sized portion but nothing special. My husband had a steak from the American menu for his main. He did enjoy it but has commented that he has had better steak and would have preferred the vegetables to be hotter.    The staff are very friendly and well presented. They also performed a couple of dance routines during our stay, it must be said that some members of staff looked more into this while some seemed to be embarrassed to be a part of it. I'm not sure that unenthusiastic dance routines to songs from Grease is quite my bag but I could see that a lot of the other diners (and the place was packed, to its credit), particularly those with kids, enjoyed the entertainment. Thankfully we weren't dining when the singer was on but had the misfortune to walk past at this point.....

No Queue in October, quickly seated & given the menu choice (italian / american) Wine price although choice was good and ""limited"" to imports mostly. However we were here to eat, enjoy the ""well renowned entertainment""    The Nacho's Shared starter was rather hot & spicy and adequate as a sharer, then the main of ""Grandma's Yeehaw Chicken & Hunters Chicken"" were simply a cut breast of chicken caked in BBQ Sauce, with 75% of the plate covered in chips to make the portion adequate enough to charge the similarily high prices.    One of the waiting staff seemed very disinterested, the entertainment was cheesy / cat strangling bad & the cabaret a hash of little songs with uninterested male dancers joining in occasionally to make it a little different. Infact the only ""clapping or cheering"" came from fellow staff members rather than any other of the tables of paying guests.    We feel they could do ALOT better, the reputation is somewhat ""coloured"" as even some local friends had only heard good things about it. We certainly will not be ""enthused"" with another table here, more local entertainment without the high prices is otherwise available, more enjoyable and with service that cannot be faulted.

You can get a cowboy plate which is XL but this is for those with a huge appitite as the normal size was more than enough and I like my food.  The ribs and burgers are amazing and the ribs are a MUST!!!!!!  The downside for me was that the large tables were all left set up for 6/8/10 seats rather than broken down to seat more smaller groups so people are left queuing downside waiting which was unnecessary I feel if these tables had been split up.  Singers come and do a song once every 15 mins at the front of the restaurant which is great the first 2 times but after that its too much and if you are sitting at the front (we were in the back luckily) you are disturbed by this and cannot be seen or served by staff during the performance for 3-4 mins.

Well, the evening we went sure enough there were people queuing but on closer inspection the place was half empty. Hmm, strange....  There were also lots of staff milling around too but no one approached us in this ( seemingly manufactured) queue for a good ten minutes. In the meantime the group in front of us got fed up of being kept waiting for no obvious reason and walked off. A waitress eventually came over to us and when we asked for a table for three she then told us to wait a minute and disappeared off again, this in a half empty resaurant! By now we were cheesed off too and chose to take our business elsewhere.

On their last night there (we stayed an extra week) they wanted to go out to a fun restaurant and we had seen Fat Mama's from the road so decided to go there as it looked lively for them. Firstly, we had to queue and my husband hates queing for anything but particularly food! We dont understand the reason as there were plenty of vacant tables. The waiters and waitresses entertain the guests by doing song and dance routines while serving. Some of them could not sing a note and they sounded like strangled cats. The service was poor, and the food was even worse. The final insult was the bill as it was the most expensive meal we had out in Paphos.

I had a poor visit to this restaurant a few years ago but decided to give it another go just last week. It was even worse than I remembered it to be; we (table for 2) waited for a table for 10 minutes, even though we could see over 10 tables available. We were seated just before the 'cabaret' started and it was the most cringeworthy thing I have ever witnessed. Customers were also given death stares by staff as they moved around the restaurant during the 'show'. Ignoring the 'entertainment', we looked to our menus - we had starters which arrived promptly and were fab, but it all went downhill from there. Our main courses were awful, with relatively small portions, and my friend had a pasta dish wish wasnt cooked fully. I ate about half my meal, and my friend barely ate a thing. When we had finished, a staff member approached our table and said 'did you not like your meal?', to which my friend replied 'no'. The staff member then said 'i didn't think so...' and proceeded to lift our plates and disappear. Next time we saw him, he was pestering a couple of British girls at a table across the restaurant. He never came back to address our complaint. It took a further 45 minutes to grab attention of a staff member to ask for our bill. We were not offered our bill or anything after our disappointing meal. We gave up waiting, paid our full bill and left.

The food is very varied, and of a good standard, and as you can guess by the name of the restaurant, the portions are very large.

The food is just OK, the portions are large, so be warned and have a real good look at the drinks prices, because they can really bump up your bill. We were a party of five (4 adults and 1 child). We knew the meals were large, so the adults shared two main courses, the child in our party had a plain burger and there was one dessert. With two bottles of wine, three beers and two cokes the bill was €115! They have tried to cater for the smaller appetite with half portions. There is intermittent cabaret and singing from the waiting staff throughout the evening, but it is not as good as it used to be, however the kids love it when Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy make a visit to the tables.

As a group of five, we're still wondering.  The portions were huge, but this is really overpriced fast food washed down with overpriced drinks.  Service was painfully slow because there were simply just not enough staff and when the food arrived, we looked at the queue that was still building, and will forever wonder. Why???  One final note, every twenty minutes or so, staff that were previously waiting tables picked up a microphone and we endured several minutes of cheesy cabaret as they danced around the tables.

We were told the latest we could book for was 7.30pm, so accepted that even though we had wanted to eat later. I had prawn cocktail, which was nice, though small, my daughter had cheese/garlic bread. Her starter was very greasy and actually too much cheese to be enjoyable. I had a fish dish to follow which said 'served with fresh vegetables and a choice of jacket or chips'. The fish was in a tarragon sauce and was quite nice but nothing special. The vegetables were a very small portion of brocolli, about a dessert spoonful of sweetcorn and some plain boiled rice - as well as my chips. My daughter's pizza was like a cheap supermarket type basic cheese and tomato variety. We didn't bother with desserts as if the other courses were anything to go by, it wouldn't have been worth it. By 7.30pm there was a long queue for tables and we were very glad we hadn't wasted our time that way and were at least able to be out of there by 8.30pm and spend the evening elsewhere. I think this place suffers from offering both an 'Italian' and an 'American' menu. It would be better sticking to one type of cuisine and doing it better. In comparison, we ate at 'Duomo' Italian restaurant on the last evening of our stay in Paphos - which was cheaper, more authentic and a much more pleasant experience altogether",NEGATIVE,0.9924099445343018

We never got a drink, the lady came over and said our table was ready by the time the man even bothered to serve us. We ordered a drink at the table but then no drinks arrived for about 10 minutes. The service was poor. Slow. Once we had ordered drinks and were waiting another waiter came over, didn't even make eye contact, was looking down at his pad of paper and just said ""do you want to order"". We replied ""do we want to order what?"" and he said ""your food"". We said ""no, we have not even had our drinks yet. A drink would be nice"". It was bad. It is such a shame because the food is amazing! They are so under staffed its a joke and if they focused on kicking the staff they have up the bottom to do work and even pretend to want to work there and be friendly, it might be OK. Expensive but the small plates they offer are big enough for a female. The bigger plates are worth it for the male customers.    They do this Fat Mama's 10 minutes little show they put on for you, great fun to watch! very slightly different every night i guess but it is still repetitive if you want to return. It was a good idea to do this and it obviously brings people in. It is always packed there and a good restaurant for food but if the staff focused on serving and being polite and wanting to be there, instead of doing a show and prancing about, then the place might be ran a little better.",NEGATIVE,0.9965662360191345

The entertainment is great, especially for the youngsters in our group and even the big kids! It makes a fun night out from that point of view and the décor is great. However the food is awful, they really need to focus on quality instead of quantity, they give huge portions of bland, tasteless food. I'm not a food snob at all, but when I'm on holiday I like to eat nice food, this is an American diner type place and the food lacks taste and flavour. The service wasn't great, mainly all English staff but they just seemed uninterested and it was hard to get a hold of one of them to get another drink or anything, then when we finally did we waited ages for it to arrive.    We went in June 2012, we were a party of 6 adults, 2 small children we had 2 sharing starters between us and each had a main meal, the children 2 kids potions and 1 adult dessert it was around 160 euros.

It is alongside and seems to share facilities and menu with Willy's Rib Ranch, although there is distinct Italian and American offerings. The music is loud and during your meal it is likely that Fat Mama and Willy will put in an appearance fully kitted out in their costumes, the kids (big and small) love the opportunity for a photo session.  As an aside the fod is good also, I had a steak and the menu had a set of pictures of cooked steaks that allowed you to show the waiter exactly the colour you wanted, mine was spot on and so really enjoyable.

Don't get me wrong I love nachos, fajhitas, burgers etc but even these simple straight forward dishes seemed beyond the chef's capabilities. The chilli in the nachos was tasteless (have you heard of seasoning?) and was served with a big dollop of sour cream but no salsa or guacamole. I had the fajhitas for a main course and the portion was huge (as are all Fat Mama's portions) but they only give you 3 flour tortillas to fill, meaning you still had half your fajhitas left and no tortillas! Extra tortillas can be purchased at 40p a throw, but seriously, just give us enough to start with and drop the fries that come as extra. Who ever heard of fajhitas served with fries??? My hubby ordered beef enchiladas as a main which turned out not to be beef but to be the same bland chilli that was used on the nachos....yuk! He ordered the small portion but once again it was unecessarily OTT big! The amount of food that must go to waste here on a nightly basis is shameful. Get a grip Fat Mama's and start focusing on the quality of your food and less on the quantity.

For such a big restaurant it should be able to serve food in a reasonable time especially as it wasnt full. so reluctantly we ordered some garlic bread the second time he 'pressured' us into it. the steaks come in two sizes, fat mamas size which stated the weight, and a smaller weight, for which it didnt state a size. i asked the waiter what size/weight 'small' was as i didnt think i could eat the large. he laughed , stumbled and said, umm smaller. the waiter could speak good English he just didnt know the weight, which is pretty poor. When the waiter came to take the empty plate from the garlic bread he said, are you ready for your steaks? We thought our order was already in the que, so why did they ask? within 5-10 minutes after the steaks were served, not the 30 minutes the waiter who ensured we had a starter had previously said. We ordered the larger steak as we had no idea how big the smaller ones were, and low and behold could not eat it all after having a starter.

Fat Mamas was different, the service was great and the menu (American / italian) was vast. The prawns with garlic sauce (off the italian menu) and fajitas (off the american menu) were some of the best i have tasted in a long long time, and i eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants in London. The portions were good and the waiters knew the menu well. We also had the ribs and whilst there fell of the bone and were extremely succulent, i felt that the sauce was a little sickly sweet, so when given the option to go standard or spicy, perhaps do a mix of the two?

I passed the restaurant a number of times early evening and noticed queues to enter (not a long wait though) and it got my interest as no other places were in such demand. Finally chose to check it out, and had a great experience.    Staff double up as entertainers, and they carry out various brief but entertaining shows through the evening. At 21:00 they do a bigger show which was again really entertaining, and these elements do add to the fun atmosphere and a glance around the place showed many happy faces.    I had my 6 and 8 year olds with me, and they were extremely well catered for, and the staff kept popping by when time permitted to interact with the kids and have fun. They soon won over the shy pair, and even played trumps with them which was well received.    Food was excellent, but as mentioned in other reviews the portion sizes were reasonably big.

My only dissapointment this time was both the canneloni and lasagne, both seemed to be the same and lacked pasta with too much white sauce. As part of a group of 10 we tried lots of different items on our last couple of trips. The other pastas were good. The meat comes in the choice of normal or large sizes. It's always tender, cooked as ordered and a challenge to finish.  The food is not the only good thing. The staff entertain with little shows of singing and dancing done to a great standard. In all my visits I have never had a complaint about the staff. Very friendly nothing is too much trouble.  Let them know if you have a special occassion and they will make it memorable.

I've been there two times and both of the times been disappointed of the taste of the food. Maybe i expect too much because in the high season they are always full. They have a queue outside and people don't mind waiting outside to be seated, although it's about 45 degrees outside and the humidity is more that 90%.

Located on the Kings Road at the Tomb of the Kings, this eatery is a must for all holiday makers to Cyprus. The food is good, well proportioned and the service is excellent. This has always been a staff ant for those with massive appetites, although of late the menu does cater for half portions which must reduce the wastage when food is left. I do like this restaurant and will visit on a regular basis, if only to watch the staff making fools of themselves with 'holiday camp' entertainment!

You get handed 2 menus...one that has mostly italian food and the other full of tex mex food. We got seated very quickly and our orders were taken quickly too. Just after the drinks arrived...the music was turned up and some of the waitresses appeared in fancy dress and started to sing and dance in the middle of the restaurant.  This was usually to wish someone a happy birthday or anniversary but good entertainment.  Then the food came and you get great big portions...we thought it would be good to shre some ribs for a starter but the portion we got could of been your main course!! It was huge! Then our main courses came and the portions were just as big. All the food was well cooked and very yummy.  The prices weren't too bad and if you dine before half 7 (If i remember) they were offering a percentage off your bill.

And my review was going to be very simple and just recommend but after reading these reviews and narrow minded people saying the que is to make the restaurant look popular where as you can see its popular from the inside not from the que on the outside. Be realistic if there wasnt a queing policy and everyone sat themselves down, there would be no way to keep track of who came in first therefore service would fail. The que is there for a reason... To ensure you get quality food and service. Do you really think the chefs can cook hundreds of peoples food at the one time. The entertainment is brilliant there not professional they are simply waiters and waitress' who get involved to make your night that little bit more enjoyable and different! 6 days out of my 7 day holiday i went to fat mamas and got to know the staff.... We found out that every member of staff has there own alicated jobs so you all try take orders in that busy restaurant, dance, take orders , dance. ALL NIGHT.

Seriously, I do not understand what is going on here. It was by far the worst meal we had during our holiday. I started by ordering chicken wings. At £7.50 for a starter portion of chicken wings, I was not expecting a plate of very small deep fried wings that were hard and tasteless. The main burger was ok though nothing better than I would expect in a very average beefeater. My Partner had a margarita pizza which she said was tasteless. The entertainment was in my opinion, shocking!!! If you have been to New York and experienced the true entertaining waitress's and waiters in cafes / restaurants, you will be very disappointed.    After our visit, it became a running joke about the poor people that were queuing every night.

Not the place to go for a quiet meal, it is a loud restaurant with lots of entertainment and we were there in August so every 15 mins a few of the staff do a cabaret act.

We waited 15 minutes outside to be seated although tables inside were free for people to be seated, I am sure they do this so Fat Mama's draw attention to people passing by thinking well if there is a que the food & service must be great! We were seated, I agree with others the waitress/waiters were all running around chucking food & drinks at you, no personal attention what so ever, just interested in seating you, taking order & clearing you out for the next people all they can see is ££££ sign's. We had 8 different waitress/waiters attend to us & not one of them asked if everything was ok or if we needed anymore drinks. More interested in singing & dancing..well i'm sorry fat mama's but you can not do both! Your staff should be there to provide a service, not try to do x factor..The large size dinner is just a large plate with tiny bit of salad a little meat and filled with chips, could get that at KFC..Overall service was very poor & meal was over rated..would not return.",NEGATIVE,0.9978284239768982

Food is bland portion sizes appear large only because they overload the plate with fries, if you take that away very little is left on the plate to be honest.  Staff rush around like idiots more interested in trying to sing!! We must if had at least six waiters, one of which was in such a rush he nearly dropped my drink on the  table and then ran of and shouted ""Catch"", the average age if the serving staff would at a guess be 16 with little or no experience, walking around with plates if food trying to read the table numbers (staff training needed I think).  Anyway, our table of six finally got our mains only to discover two where missing! Ten minutes passed and another waiter noticed, came back from the kitchen and told us the grill had broken hence the delay on our two missing burgers, what he failed to realise is that we could see the kitchen from our table and could see other burgers being cooked! When this was pointed out he shrugged his shoulders and walked off.  As for the entertainment has the same routine, same songs, same staff and is crap to be honest.  Restaurant always looks busy but that's because they sit everybody at the front to force a quee outside.  Huge choice on the menu but simply many variations of the same thing.  All in all a very hot, stuffy, overpriced, poorly staffed and on a very busy main road so avoid and ignore the hype it really is Rubbish",NEGATIVE,0.9997579455375671

Service was sporadic with different waiting staff throughout the meal, food not cooked as requested.    Many will say that people queue around the corner to come here - they do - that's because the staff are playing 'the game' - leave tables at the back empty and the front full to ensure a queue before allowing others to enter and be seated.    Also check your bill as the prices displayed for drinks on your table are different to those displayed on your bill - an old menu they will say !

For this, if you want to keep the kids quiet and happy for 90 minutes I would recommend the experience. Dont be afraid of the queue outside, they turn the tables quickly so the wait is not as long as the queue suggests. The portions of food are enormous, unless you are used to large food portions, I would avoid the starters. The negative for me was the food was just ok - texmex and italian. The kids ordered burger and ribs, I had fajitas. All the food was ok but I didnt walk away thinking the food was great, and considering it was the most expensive meal I had in Paphos, I expected better.",POSITIVE,0.9154757857322693

Having said that quite a few meals on the menu offer a smaller portion size which is a great idea. I would definitely recommend the smaller portion if you want to try out one of their delicious desserts !! The entertainment took us by surprise but is good fun and livens things up.

This place was by far the best dining experience we had.  Food quality was excellent, portion sizes very generous, and attentive staff , who periodically entertain the clientele. My personal reccommendation would be the ribs, which are to die for, and some of the best i have ever tasted. Prices were very reasonable in our view. Well worth a visit, and if you go early ther is a discount offered.  It does get very busy, and they do not take reservations.",POSITIVE,0.9986714124679565

It more than lived up to the hype! The Menu was massive, but not quite as massive as the portion sizes. The hospitality was some of the best iv ever seen and for the quality and size of the meals you pay for, they were incredible value for money. Anyone who likes a tasty challenge has to try the Ribs, 24 delicious bbq ribs and a side of chips, I'm a big fan of eating an I couldn't finish them all. If when you visit there is a special occasion for someone in your group, like a birthday or anniversary then prepare for a fuss, I won't spoil it for anyone but they love special occasions at Fat Mama's.

They do take bookings up until 7.30pm which you need to do by e-mail or in person - no phone reservations, otherwise, turn up and queue.  The restaurant was packed and the staff were providing a great atmosphere. They have two separate menu's, one American/Mexican and one Italian. The portions were huge and ever so tasty, if you are in to ribs make sure you get them, biggest portion I have ever seen. Also recommend the fajitas (steak or chicken) and the pizza's are lovely and light.  Every now and then, members of staff would burst in to song and dance in the middle of the restaurant which was very entertaining, then they would make their way to diners who were celebrating birthdays, weddings etc and would have the whole place joining in. Lots of fun. Also, anytime someone passed compliments to the chef, waiting staff would shout it to the kitchen and all staff would cheer. There was also an appearance by fat mama herself!
