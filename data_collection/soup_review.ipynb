I went the last time here, 8 years ago and it’s still the same, guaranteed tasty food and as you’ve read, huge portions....Staff are very friendly and make you feel so welcome, mostly family I believe.\n",

Our only feedback would be to put some more vegetarian options on the menu. The dancers...are and it’s obvious how much they love their role!  Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend.More\n",

The staff were fun especially the young female staff member who I couldn't help but make fun of and who gave...it back in truckloads (yes, you with the big round glasses!). A great diversion away from the All Inclusive for one night, would definitely recommend.\n",
