Had to go back as our daughters enjoyed the show so much (so did we).  I went the last time here, 8 years ago and it’s still the same, guaranteed tasty food and as you’ve read, huge portions....Staff are very friendly and make you feel so welcome, mostly family I believe.
The lady who does glitter tattoos/nail art outside nightly is brilliant and very talented. All in all a great night out esp if you have children.More",5

350darrenw,51 reviews,"Reviewed October 12, 2022",Date of visit: October 2022,Disappointed,"Really disappointed, have been coming here for 20 years but post covid this restaurant isn’t a patch on what it used to be. 
The menu used to be varied and big but now (I guess because of covid) it is small and unexciting. 
The starter...of prawn cocktail would be better described as lettuce with a prawn flavouring, with the big dish almost full of lettuce. 
The main courses were ok but certainly nothing special, and definitely nowhere near the size the used to be (which were stupidly big to be fair). 
Staff were very professional and friendly and entertainment is more of a gimmick now than a reason to go there. 
Sad really, probably what was my favourite restaurant in Paphos is probably now near the bottom of my go to list.More",3
