We were recommended to go here while in Paphos but I had no idea there would be live dancers. Made for a very enjoyable night. Food was great with big portions and you could tell a lot of work has gone into the acts.,,
"Had some food and a few beers, as a band played some nice music. Baglárka helped us pick a nice Palinka and we had a great evening",,
"What a lovely evening, the staff couldn’t of been more helpful.the young girls dancing were a joy x my family all thought the food was fantastic and was a lovely end to our granddaughters visit . Thank you so much Audrey kempton and family",,
"2nd night out of 4 for us. Had to go back as our daughters enjoyed the show so much (so did we). I went the last time here, 8 years ago and it’s still the same, guaranteed tasty food and as you’ve read, huge portions....More",,
"Food really good, fantastic service, and dancers, what more do you need. Service really good too. Very large portions, if you order nachos as a starter, you need to share with someone",,
"Brilliant food , service and show defiantly recommend a visit here portion area plenty full so be warned ha ha .It was nice not to be rushed.",,
Again rain pounding down so jumped in here really nice but loud and has dancers Got starters mushrooms and ravioli then fajitas and pizza All really good really nice place especially for families,,
"Our first time here and we were not dissapointed. Staff were amazing very efficient and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Food was good and plentiful and reasonably priced. Our only feedback would be to put some more vegetarian options on the menu. The dancers...More",,
"We literally stumbled across this restaurant whilst on our holiday from the UK. We had a fabulous meal, very good considerate service and surrounded with a vibrant atmosphere as the life band played. Highly recommend the Hungarian goulash with pie bread. Not to be missed.",,
"Really disappointed, have been coming here for 20 years but post covid this restaurant isn’t a patch on what it used to be. The menu used to be varied and big but now (I guess because of covid) it is small and unexciting. The starter...More",,
"The service was super kind, the starters we had were good (halloumi and nacho's), the main dishes were avarage. The entertainment makes it lively but not really our kind of entertainment. Overall a good experience!",,
"Great food, family friendly atmosphere and amazing Fat mammas dancers1 those girls work so hard putting together at least 3 different routines a week,its so much fun ! We had burgers and ribs - massive portions great value for money .",,
"Great food, service and entertainment. The family had a really fun night and even our little 8 month niece was transfixed by the dancers. The staff were fun especially the young female staff member who I couldn't help but make fun of and who gave...More",,
"It was so good to return to Fat Mama’s and we were not disappointed! The same fabulous food, great service and of course brilliant entertainment! The cabaret show did not disappoint and our 18 month old was in awe of everything! We loved our visit...More",,
The cabaret show was great. Unfortunately the food wasn't. Had chilli con carne there was a hard skin on rice. Another of our party had chicken which they couldn't cut it was so tough.,,
"Great service here, nice food (huge portions!) and the dancers are fun.. Great place to start your evening and move onto somewhere else for drinks",,
Brilliant food and great entertainment. We had the fillet steaks and it would be hard to find a better one anywhere in the world. Friendly staff and great dancers throughout the night.,,
Food and the atmosphere both excellent. We enjoyed it so much came back twice. The food/drinks are reasonably priced. Looking forward to visiting again in the future.,,
Ordered fillet steak for the wife and had small ribs myself. The portions were plentiful and neither of us could finish the plate. Staff were friendly and unfortunately we were too early for the main show that starts at 20:35. There is also a 10% discount if you pay in cash before 19:00,,
"Brilliant dancers and entertainment, we loved that. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were absolutely huge. Overall a really great place!",,
"We visited fat mamas after a friend recommended to my parents who recommended to my sister who then recommended to us!    6 adults, 3 year old girl and 1 year old boy. Well… entertainment was fabulous my little girl loved the dancing and would like to apply in the future! And our son seemed pretty chuffed to find himself a blond babe to hold him haha. The dancing was so much fun and the singing even better! All in all just a wonderful atmosphere full of family celebrations and lots of laughs!    We really enjoyed the food, regulars to Cyprus (half Greek) it was actually really nice to not have the same Greek food and have something different whilst here! (Let’s be honest once you’ve had a meze there’s only so much more you can go for)    For the children we ordered the childrens pizza and some fries and that was plenty for them to share! I had the steak and halloumi fajitas and portion size is big so would suggest maybe sharing and ordering extra tortillas with these, they were honestly the best fajitas I have ever had. My mum had the ribs which were super meaty and super tasty which in my experience is rare in Cyprus and other Greek islands so she was really happy. My dad had a sea bass, partner enchiladas and the others got some burgers. All the food was really yummy and full of flavour it was honestly like TGI FRIDAYS had collaborated with TUI we adored the girls and could really see how much work they have put in to make a wonderful show suitable for all the family!    Drinks - there is a happy hour and would recommend getting there early to take advantage of this. We had various cocktails, beers and soft drinks for drivers and kids and got them241 during the happy hoursss    We had such a great time at fat mamas that we are looking to return for a second time this holiday. We have done lots of lovely things and the one request from the children and the family is that we return for an evening there before we leave for another year!    Basically after all my rambling is that if you want yummy food, great entertainment and fabulous service this is the place for you!",,
"We have been excited to come to fat mamas for our engagement meal, but, after some of the responses from the manager on here we have made the decision to go to the harbour to eat this evening. Very unprofessional responses and attitude towards paying customers. I hope this may have changed for our next visit.",,
"Food was great , Very big portions the down side was the service took ages to order then waited 45 minutes for starters we only got that because we said something it got forgotten in kitchen",,
"Visited in August 2022, hadn't read any reviews but word of mouth from friends who live in Cyprus. Wow! Absolutely fantastic night... food was great (we all had Mexican except our 9-year-old daughter who had the ribs from the children's menu) So tasty and so much food! not one of us finished, but it was happily bagged up for us to take back to our holiday stay. Entertainment is brilliant, daughter was very happy to meet Fat Mama and even had her face painted on the sidewalk next to our table while we finished up. Staff were friendly and attentive, wanted to visit again before leaving but just didn't get chance. Definitely on our to do list when we visit again.",,
"Visited this restaurant from a recommendation, cabaret entertainment kept the children entertained. Food was not very good the night we visited, we were a family of 8 and 3 of the burgers that was ordered was not good at all. We had quite a long wait from ordering to food arriving and staff too busy to take drinks orders.  It was quite expensive for what we had, maybe it was just an off night for the restaurant, but would not go back.",,
Visited the restaurant with friends which were on holiday to the island. We had an enjoyable meal outdoors. Lots of menu selections and wines. We recommend.,,
Visited here yesterday. What a great place with the emphasis on fun and food. Staff are all brilliant and fun to chat with. Great banter. The dancers were great and we had a visit from Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy. The food was excellent. Shrimp cocktail was lush . The ribs are amazing but be warned they are big portions so go for the small size is my advice. Drinks are good quality although some brands are a bit expensive. Great Liqueur Coffee. All in all a fab evening. Thank you to all the staff for a great time.,,
"We went for the evening on 9th of September. The food was lovely and huge portions, my partner had the ribs, please don't order the regular size as its enormous! The small was a challenge. Really fun evening with dancers periodically through the night.  Go early as queueing after 7.30ish.  I would highly recommend this place for a fun evening with fantastic food.",,
Just visited Fat Mama's tonight! First time in five years! Food was perfect in many ways friendly staff service with a smile and wonderful cabaret show to finish off. Good luck Karen and Phil ( Liverpool ),,
"Fab restaurant!  Such an atmosphere, welcomed soon as you arrive.  Staff so friendly, good variety of food and OMG portion sizes wow!!  Loved the entertainment part of the whole restaurant experience.  Every night it’s entertainment night…    If you pay by cash you get 5% of your bill which is nice.  Definitely recommend this over and over to people.  First time at this restaurant, loved the feel even before entering today just a walk by when arrive at Paphos on Sunday",,
"I was excited to visit due to all the hype but was disappointed, although they were very accommodating for our large party it was a pain we couldn’t separate bills per family as all have different opinions on service charge/tips etc so was a pain working it out, food was bland, portions too big, my brother paid €40 for a steak and only ate half as he said it was like an old boot, we were charged for 7 bottles of water at €2.40 each but only had 4, the entertainment stayed solely at the entrance although the videos online lead us to believe it was a bit of a noisy wild night dancing around everyone etc but it was not, to be honest I was quite bored, good night but not by any means great",,
"Absolutely great fun and stunning food. We felt welcome from the moment we arrived, and the service was so on point! The best fillet steak I have ever had",,
"We loved spending time at Fat Mama's during our time in Paphos. We did not eat here but we spent a few nights drinking here. At stages throughout the night, they have a dance show where 3 woman come on for around 15 minutes, every night we were there it was different and they really entertained the crowd, perfect fot the children to watch on the 'front row' whilst the parents could continue eating/drinking, the girls even posed for photos at the end. We felt some staff members worked considerably harder than others, one female in particular was cleaning tables, seating people down, taking orders, taking payments when 2 gentleman seemed to just be walking around, so hats of to her!!!",,
"Came to Fat Mammas on the recommendation of friends years ago and now it’s always on our holiday to do list! Did not disappoint our party of 9 again this year. Excellent food, massive portions and the entertainment throughout the night kept everyone in the party mood - we will definitely be back",,
"Booked a table, for a family birthday meal, which wasn't ready. Had to wait for the 'entertainment' to finish before being seated. Forty minutes or more after getting our drinks we were still waiting to have our food order taken. Settled our drinks bill and left, but staff still seemed more bothered about making sure the 'entertainment' was sorted than making sure we had paid.",,
"We had the best night at Fat Mama's as our last night in Cyprus  Great food, excellent service and outstanding entertainment!  Would recommend anyone visiting Paphos should book a table here as it's a great night out and we were lucky to meet Stavros Flatley too!",,
"We came here as a family of three, the service was great all the staff very friendly and very speedy. Portions are huge and the food tasted great. Great offers on drinks. We had not heard about this place so was very happily surprised by the dancing and appearance of Fat mama herself. We will be back again",,
"Heard so many good things about this place.tje food was plentiful and nice but it certainly isn't worth the hype that surrounds this place there is much better entertainment at other local bars and of much higher quality. Can't say we would go back but it wouldn't be too of a list of things to do, very impersonal and felt like a conveyor belt for tables",,
"I’ll start with a summary. This is a fun restaurant, perfect for those with large appetites and no sense of taste.  This is a popular theme/gimmick restaurant in as much as every 20 minutes, 3 girls come out and dance for a couple of minutes. They even dressed as characters in large costumes at one point but the costumes were threadbare and it seemed quite awkward. The food was bland at best. I ordered the beef fajitas and there could not have been any seasoning added whatsoever - not even salt and pepper. I cannot remember a time where I was so disappointed in my food. I was given about 1 teaspoon of guacamole to cover 4 wraps. My wife and daughter had chicken salads and they were ok. The worst part were the drinks; we were happy to have arrived just in time for the 2 for 1 cocktail offer. I ordered mojitos and my wife ordered Margaritas. Neither appeared to contain more than a dribble of alcohol. - we certainly couldn’t taste it. The kids had Fanta but they said they didn’t taste like Fanta. Portion sizes are large but bulked up by cheap ingredients. Service was fine and atmosphere was fun, although the entertainers did ask the table behind us if their young child could pretend it was his birthday so they could perform their cheesy happy birthday routine - the poor lad didn’t look happy",,
Visited many times in the past & it’s always a great experience. Food amazing though portions are huge so if ordering a starter beware. Staff are great and entertainment is fun. Prices obviously vary I ordered a pizza which was only about £10 but my friend has to have the rattlesnake steak when he visits which was £30. Also can’t order wine by the glass so a bottle set us back £24 which would be fine if you can share. We went quite late about 9.30 and had to wait about 15 mins if you go peak time then expect a longer wait but if you’re in no rush then it’s worth it,,
Great food and excellent service. Pizzas are really good. Portions are large. One of my daughters only had the potato skins starter as her main and she didn’t finish it. We went early when the restaurant was quiet but plenty of friendly staff on hand.,,
"Confused by the good reviews on here. We were really disappointed with all our food. The focus seems to be on quantity rather than quality. Massive portions of really poor quality tasteless food.  The only thing worse than the food was the service. We waited a good 15 minutes at the entrance waiting to be seated (at a booked table), then waited another 30 minutes on someone taking our food order, then waited and waited for our food to be served.  Much better food and service nearby, we won’t be back.",,
"Food is of good standard, no issues with that. Portions were massive!  If you want a quiet meal you really need to avoid though as its full on here. Every 20 mins or so, ladies come out and sing and dance to a theme. They are actually quite talented to be fair.  Its a noisy, extremely busy restaurant, which at times seems chaotic but its a great meal out for families especially with young children. Overall worth a visit!",,
"Amazing show, great food and flawless service!!!! Great job you guys !!!! Definitely recommend it to everybody that comes to Paphos",,
"This place has to be the best restaurant in Cyprus , the atmosphere was amazing , the food was amazing, the service staff work so hard..the cabaret girls are awesome.. whoever visits paphos needs to experience this restaurant, you won't find anywhere better ..thank you for...",,
Great food as always. My daughter loved the girls dancing she now wants to work at fat mama’s! We celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary here and they brought out a glass of Prosecco for us which was a lovely surprise. My son enjoyed the entertainment especially the singing. Was a great night. Definitely recommend!,,
"We has a perfect evening! The food was absolutely delicious, the service is 5 stars and the show with the three girls was top notch! We will definitely visit soon!! Keep up the excellent job!",,
"This restaurants never disappoints. We came here first approx 17yrs ago. On our trip to Paphos this time it was the first stop on our list. The cheesy garlic bread is fantastic and was still as good as it was the first time we came. Burgers are massive and ribs and pizza are all firm favourites. Portion sizes are big esp for starter. It is more than a restuurant experience, there is dancer's and singing approx every 15/20mins and even Stavros Flatley paid a visit whilst were there. Definately worth a visit for anyone that is looking great atmosphere, good food and a relaxed environment.",,
From food to service to entertainment it was a night to remember.  Where to start the food portions are the biggest you will ever see  .  Started with nachos and it would have served 3    Main course was fajitas and I 4 tortias. When I was finished you would have thought I had not started as there was that much food left.  Waiters were great always happy to help.  The entertainment was great the girls sang and danced there heart out. Made for an amazing family meal,,
"We visited fat mammas for an evenings food and entertainment, and it did not disappoint. From the amazing front of house staff, a bubbly and talented lady from Essex uk, to the superbly efficient table staff and the entertainers, fat mammas delivered an evening that stood out during our holiday. The starter was the size of a main meal… honestly, the bruschetta was basically a whole loaf of bread (!!) and the truly delicious pasta was to die for. we did not leave hungry and could not manage a dessert, despite the desserts looking delicious!  We were entertained by the dancers and weather was perfect to add to the holiday vibe.  We would definitely recommend!!  Thanks for a fabulous evening xx",,
Food great service great entertainment great price great what more do you want! You will find this easily enough as it's the packed every night,,
"Very suited to families and celebrations. A big menu of burgers, steak, pizza etc. We didn't book but got a table easily enough. Nice staff but nobody really checks on you once you've ordered. My husband had ribs, the small portion which were massive, and I had prawns in wine and garlic. It came with rice, a baked potato and a salad. The portions are just too big but the food itself is good. Also had a milkshake which was just milk and strawberry syrup so a little disappointing. Had to ask for the bill a few times and in the end just left cash as nobody came with the card machine. The night we went there was a trio dancing to various songs.",,
"The food was nice and it had a nice atmosphere however as an autistic person it was a nightmare, loud music and constant shouting and we had to wait an extra hour to get the bill, as previously stated it was enjoyable but definitely not autism friendly",,
"Booked a table for 8pm, arrived at 8pm and asked the people in the queue if they had made a reservation and they had not. Went to the guy at the desk and advised we had booked in for 8pm and gave him my name, he said “oh, I know about your booking but I forgot to add your name to the list. You’ll need to wait like everyone else now” This was behind approx 14 people. When I asked what was the point on us booking, he said the booking only keeps the table free??? He didn’t know his left hand from his right!! Eventually sat down and ordered drinks, but after waiting a further 20 mins, we still didn’t have our drinks so we told the waitress to cancel the order and left.  Loads of nice bars on that strip that will serve you straight away and be grateful of your custom. Give them a try!",,
We had an evening meal and the staff were great with dancing girls every few minutes . There was a good choice of food and great for families with the entertainment. 10% off for early eating by 7pm with good value drinks offers as well.,,
After listening to people at our hotel saying about this place we thought we would give it a go. Arrived at about 6.30 pm & got a table. If you go later than about 7 you will struggle to get a table. Also before 7pm it's 15 % early bird discount so we were told. All I can say is its overated & nothing special. It seems that families & younger people like this place but not us. More emphasis should be placed on the quality of the food & not the entertainment that appears about every 20 minutes or so. There is a good choice of food but it's just like being back in England at a Harvester or Smith & Westerns. Overpriced for what you get.,,
"I Don’t really know where to start, this place is Absolutely amazing! The staff went above and beyond for us from start to finish………My husband and I arrived literally just after he was bitten/stung by an insect. He has anaphylactic shocks to Bee and wasps stings. He had already started with the symptoms of swelling and redness, the owner/manager went out of her way to get things to help him. Even offered to get a family member who is a nurse on standby in case it turned nasty. Luckily it calmed down, constant checks, with care and compassion including offers of assistance and natural remedies to help. Even sent us away with supplies. We Can not thank her enough for her care and compassion. What was a scary and very anxious situation for us was made much easier to cope with.  The food was amazing!! Massive portions but absolutely beautiful felt bad we couldn’t finish our meals but again offers of take away boxes.  The shows were fantastic.  So much effort goes into making this place as fabulous as it is.  Thank you ❤️",,
"Went to fat mamas for the first time yesterday. The staff were very friendly.For starters we got garlic bread with cheese, potato skins and bruschetta. Then for mains we ordered two pizzas and a hunters chicken. The sizes very big and we had to take home 1/2 of a pizza. The dancers were very entertaining especially the final show. In the front garden o the night we were there there was face painting nails and henna tattoos being done.Would recommend",,
"We visited recently with my wife's brother and his family. The food is fabulous (ribs, enchiladas, etc)., and arrives in very generous quantities. It does help if you're a carnivore, although they do have veggie options. Someone in my party let slip that it had recently been my birthday, so I had a not unpleasant surprise during the evening! It's a fantastic place to visit, especially if you have children who appreciate their meat. The dancers put on a great show and work really hard for their money. We will definitely return. Highly recommended.",,
"Decided to head to Fat Mamma's for a meal one evening, rather than staying at the hotel.    We weren't disappointed. Staff were very friendly and polite. Food was good, although we only had starters as we weren't that hungry and cocktails very lovely. My sister ate here a couple of nights beforehand and the mina meal portions are huge!    We had a shout out as we got married on the island and were given a complimentary drink.    The entertainment was great (3 resident girls dancing).    Defo worth a visit!",,
"If your in Paphos, you have to visit Fat Mammas. Omg the food is absolutely incredible but you also get to watch a show while you eat. It's a family run business and so friendly, efficient and memorable. Portions are huge. Variety of food incredible. If you go early into your holiday I can guarantee you will go back again. Can't wait for our next holiday to go back .",,
"We had such a great time here as a group of 15+ and 6 young kids with us. The kids got glitter tattoos, the food was great for them and the atmosphere and entertainment was amazing! Our food and drinks were very good too! I’d like to specially say that our waitress with the brown hair was very friendly and very good with the children! She made the experience very lovely. Thank you!",,
What a brilliant night second visit this holiday and both times the food was amazing the staff outstanding position size Incredible (and I an no stranger to a big dinner) the dancers are fabulous and would not be out of place on a cruise ship I don't know her name but when the waitress turned up in a sparkling dress and sung like an angle I was super Impressed and to top it all off syavros flaty did a turn thank you all the staff I clouding cooks and the amazing beautiful waitress you made our holiday x,,
"Visited this place when walking down the street and Noticed the pretty aesthetic and cool atmosphere. The food was so good, and the frozen cocktails made it for me! Will definitely return. 10/10!",,
"Amazing food, drinks and service!😍 We’ll most definitely be back! Thank you for a lovely evening!xx",,
"Thought Fat Mamas was so good that we tried it for a 2nd time just to make sure.  Firstly the staff are very engaging and friendly. Very jolly from the the man on the door the waiters/waitresses and the cooks.  The food is all cooked fresh and they are happy to give you time between courses, even asking when you will be ready for mains/deserts.  We have had the mushrooms and the brusetta for starts and the burger and ribs for mains. Partner had the mushrooms and the lasagne and previously the enchiladas.  I would have to say that this place is not called Fat Mamas for nothing. We have not managed to finish any of the dishes served. I believe that ""Man V Food"" would struggle. So always large portions.  They have some dancers for entertainment and some music, all of which is great fun and makes the evening more enjoyable.  We would definitely visit again and would highly recommend.",,
"What a great place. The staff could not do enough for us. The food is great but the portions are very big, would recommend sharing starter’s. Will definitely be back and will be telling all my friends where to come when staying in Paphos.",,
"Been here twice this week, both times were excellent!! Portions are large so definitely share a starter! The staff are amazing, helpful and very attentive!! The entertainment was great!! Nothing is too much trouble for them. We’re coming back tomorrow on our last night as it is so good!!!",,
Family of eight visited and had a great time. Food was excellent and good entertainment. Really good value for money.,,
We had not planned to eat here but decided to on passing as the place was full. The menu had a good range of options and we enjoyed the evening.  Points for improvement - better seasoning of burgers and we consider drinks here are over-priced compared to neighbouring restaurants and eateries. Three Little Pigs is better on food and value.,,
"I visited with 2 friends in September 2021. The restaurant was quiet. The service felt quite chaotic. It took a long time for our orders to be taken and a long time for the food and drink to come out. It was really difficult to get the attention of the staff members and when I politely said I had been waiting 30 mins for a mojito that still had not arrived. I was told it was taking a long time because they had to crush the ice ( like it was my fault for ordering a complicated drink lol) the food was not very tasty. I had the fajitas, it was all quite bland and expensive for what it was.",,
It’s been a few years since we visited fat mamas and the food and atmosphere did not disappoint. Fantastic Cabernet as always but extra special with it being Halloween. Compliments to the chef!,,
It is a good restaurant very good service and a lot of food choices great to visit with family friends or you can go alone very very good food,,
Best place iv been to in Paphos staff are amazing made us feel very welcome would definitely recommend to Anybody beautiful people and amazing atmosphere !!!,,
"Had a lovely meal as always great service and entertainment too, always try and visit once each holiday",,
Came here as a last minute walk in and the staff were excellent from the get go. Super attentive to the kids which continued throughout the meal. The food was excellent there was a show throughout which the kids loved. One of the best surprises of the holiday. We'll done guys and thank you for an excellent evening.,,
Busy family run restaurant. Had to wait for a table but not for too long. Plenty of food. Attentive staff. Dancers very entertaining. Would definitely go back.,,
Booked a table and arrived to be told to wait in the queue with our two young children.. We waited and waited whilst they occasionally let people with no booking take tables ahead of us. People pushing in in front of us in the queue. Dancing girls looked like they had spent too much time in lockdown eating. Terrible experience and almost half hour completely wasted. Left and had an amazing Italian just up the road at Martelli’s.,,
"Highly recommend fat mamas food great and loads of it, great friendly staff and good entertainment don’t miss this restaurant",,
"Happened to drop in here on what was a quiet night for us. Ended up having a great time with live dancers and cabaret. We thought this was the highlight until we received the food which we are still raving about and wow talk about portion sizes,, FANTASTIC great work all at Fat Mamas you made our evening.",,
"Booked a table for 6, seated quickly even with showing Covid safe passes, lovely service from very polite people, food plentiful and piping hot. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening, would recommend",,
Visited Fat Mamas for the first time tonight. The food was excellent and the service from Andy & Samson was great. Thanks for a wonderful evening,,
"They have the best food I’ve ever eaten in my whole life, and Im not exagerating. Absolutely amazing food (you should try the meat platter or the nachos). The staff is also very friendly and they have cabaret shows almost every night.",,
"The food was great, we had mussels and garlic bread as a starter and king prawns and sea bass for main course. The house wine was very nice and even though we were the last to leave they didn’t push us out. The staff Andy, Samson and his brother (sorry forgot your name! ) we’re all very friendly, great service and overall a lovely friendly atmosphere. Unfortunately the entertainment was just finishing as we got there at about 9pm.",,
"We had a wonderful evening. Excellent and friendly service right from the greeting. Tasty food. Knowledgeable waiter. Good entertainment and vibes. Many happy diners around us. Families, children, elderly, couples - all looked after. They played happy birthday for three different tables, with a dance act each! Fully recommend it. The food was delicious. Good portion sizes. We will be going back before we head home.",,
"Absolutely brilliant. Food was awesome, service was the same and the price... you get a bit of bang for your buck.    My wife and I both has the ""small"" ribs. Nothing small about them. It was a full rack. The large was 2 full racks.    Flapper girls came out every 15 minutes. Good entertainment for ""the kids""    Will be back.",,
Went in a group of seven with ages from 9-50 and nobody was disappointed. The staff were really polite and chatty whilst being efficient at taking drink and food orders even know they were extremely busy. The shows were brilliant and really added to a unique atmosphere. I read a review saying that the food portions weren’t as big as they expected and let me just say that person has some serious issues! The portions are huge - even when you ask for a small it’s still huge!  We all had a brilliant time and wouldn’t hesitate to go back if we went back to Cyprus again,,
"Highly recommend please note we asked for small portions which we never normally do, the portions are huge! Gorgeous Filet steak at Fantastic prices and entertained by the Team which made for a fantastic atmosphere! Thank you definitely one of our favourites visited twice during our stay. We’ll be back",,
Super nice food. Very good and fast service! If you come before 19 you get a nice price for food and cocktails. I had a nice birthday💕😍🎉🎉,,
"Fat Mamas is amazing, really good food, portions are very generous. Excellent staff who are very attentive, even when really busy.. Such good atmosphere. The dancers are really good. Highly recommend.",,
"Wow !!!! Those ribs !! This place is amazing , awesome ribs and massive portion sizes , entertainment is great , staff very friendly",,
"Massive portions served here. Basic food but very tasty. Can recommend the chicken burgers. Proper chicken fillets, not the pre processed chicken served elsewhere. The staff put on a dancing show every night for diners. Keenly priced meals.",,
"This place is great. Food was really good, we didn't wait long for service and prices were reasonable. Quite a few people were queing in front of us for a table welwyn we got there but we weren't waiting long. Portions were big! And just as we were leaving, the cabaret show started which we were unaware of. A great suprise!",,
"Friendly staff at the entrance, politely asked for our Cyprus flight certificates and sat us down to eat .We ordered two stakes well done one with Diane sauce.They were amazing it has to be said and what with the entertainment this was an excellent night out thanks to all the staff at Fat mama's .",,
"Visited on chance one evening and boy we were not sorry, the food was amazing and to top it off there was entertainment while you ate. If your a fan of spare ribs go for Fat Mamas Special it’s two full rack of ribs in sauce and chips as a side. The 3 girl dancers are fantastic to watch and keen as mustard to entertain.",,
"Nothing has changed, lovely food, great entertainment and great value for the family! Tried the ribs, burgers, enchiladas and steak over 4 visits, all first class!",,
"Having visited several times before over the years last nights meal came as a huge disappointment to us. The nicest possible way I can describe it is-vile!  Not sure if it’s changed ownership or chef but the steak was not cooked as I’d asked, and it was cold, the sauce that topped it was cold and set like jelly.  The mussels nearly ripped my mouth open as the first 2 I ate had sharp shell in, this was then visible from the shell. Clearly no care when washing them or Perhaps not as the third and final one I ate was full of sand!  They also charge extra for paying on card €10. So if you do dare visit make sure you take cash",,
"The food was just good. Very tasty and creative drinks. Nice service, we were seated quickly, got food fast, and had a nice conversation with the waiter. This is not a place for a romantic evening. Every night there are animations with costumes and loud music. Maybe some people would like it, like families with kids, but for us it was annoying and too much. Tried once, didn't go back.",,
"The staff were friendly enough however the food was extremely basic. Portion sizes were either too little or too large and there were issues with the temperature of the foods we received. On top of this we were left waiting for 15 minutes to cutlery with little attention being paid to us. Overall this may be a safe option for people with young families due to the entertainment and basic food on offer, but I highly recommend any people looking for good food to avoid here",,
"Can’t praise enough! Value for money, food, staff all excellent. 10/10. Made to feel so welcome it has to be a must to visit here if holidaying in the area! We visited twice on a ten day holiday",,
"Surpasses all expectations! food fabulous, large portions so fantastic value too. staff are really attentive especially Cathy who made us so welcome. Would definitely pay another visit especially for the entertainment 🙌",,
"Such a welcoming, humble eatery.  The staff could not be more friendly.  Food was fresh and tasty reasonably priced especially as free entertainment is given.  The dancers work so hard to entertain and create a great atmosphere. The restaurant has a staff singer, possibly owner. She is amazing such a great voice and finished the night with kindness and warmth. Great night start to finish. Highly recommend as a family place to eat.",,
"This is a staple visit for us, service, atmosphere and food are always excellent. Tried lots over the years and never disappoints. Reduced fries size which is better as used to supply way to many Prices very reasonable",,
"We went here for a family meal on recommendation from friends and it didn’t disappoint. Food was lovely with first class service and the staff were very playful with the kids. To top it all off the entertainment from the ‘Fat mamma’s dancers’ was brilliant. It was no surprise when, later in the holiday, we asked the kids where they want to eat and in a second they both said “Fat mamma’s…!”  It’s a simple recipe…if the kids have a great time, the parents do to, but this place knocked it out of the park on all fronts.",,
"Great food, tried enchiladas, pizzas and fajitas. Very good prices, excellent service, good environment.",,
Came here with family and 16 children the final bill was impeccable and the free entertainment on show was absolutely amazing. Loved every minute of my experience and will be coming back!,,
We have tried fat mamas during our stay and I would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff it's amazing Good food and the show is fantastic,,
The food was very good. The portions are big and good. Especially the burgers. Also the staff is very friendly. My only issue is the the drinks are very expensive.  There is a cabaret show by three girls. It is kind of out of place but the girls are doing a good job and is nice to watch!,,
"This restaurant was recommended to us 5 times before we even left for Cyprus and it did not disappoint!  We went back 3 times during our stay, the staff are so friendly and even remembered our names on each visit. They were fantastic with our daughter, they even got her up dancing and the dancers bought her over a free cocktail on our last night which was such a nice touch.  Food was lovely and generous portions, I recommend the Pizza and the Lasagne.  Our daughter is still talking about this restaurant now, so we would highly recommend and we would definitely be going back when we return to Cyrpus.  If you want to see the most of the evening entertainment, I would recommend booking your table for about 7.45pm and stay until the end of the show for a great night out!",,
We went to fat mamas last night food was absolutely amazing and there not shy on there portion size there huge Services was fantastic and the entertainment they have on is amazing. Cant wait to visit again,,
"After having this restaurant recommended through our hotel Facebook page we thought we would give it a try. We were notndissapointed they were extremely friendly, fantastic with our children. Food was plentiful, lots of choice and absolutely delicious. Great value for money and to top it off they do a free cabaret show each evening. We all had a fantastic time well worth the visit and highly recommend.",,
"Our 2 and 6yr olds loved the experience - the costume characters of Mama & Willy, the dancers and the lady outside who does face painting and sparkle tattoos (€5-10). Generally, was great to go somewhere that put on a show and had an atmosphere at a time when most restaurants are dead because of limited tourism thanks to Covid.    Food portions are large - but it’s quantity over quality. We had ribs (v tender, salty, good but not great) and a halloumi burger (stodgy). House wine is awful - had to send it back. Drinks more expensive than neighbouring restaurants.    Staff friendly but whoever from restaurant who leaves comments on trip advisor replying to negative reviews is quite rude!    Overall a great place for kids. Less appealing if you don’t have children.",,
Had dinner here whilst away on a family holiday in September. Had chicken wings to start potion was good size and wings were excellent and juicy. Had one of the signature burgers for a main and it was fantastic juicy and very filling. All the party fully enjoyed it. Dancing girls were also very entertaining doing various routines throughout the evening. Restaurant is also very covid secure will definitely return in the future.,,
Me and my partner came here with our 2 year old one evening. Everybody who worked here was lovely and a real credit to the restaurant. The portions where absolutely huge and we where rightly advised by the waiter to share the nachos for starter. The mains where huge and good value for money.    They made a fuss of our little boy which was nice of them and all in all it was a good experience at a reasonable price thanks to the 15% discount they offered at the time.    Would happily come again next time I am in Paphos. Thanks everyone!,,
Great food. Great entertainment. Great atmosphere and great staff. Can't fault it and if you're lucky you might bump into a celebrity 😉,,
"Always worth a visit. Super COVID safe and great food and entertainment. I had baby ribs and they were delicious but so huge I took the rest home,",,
"Amazing place with fair prices, fast service ,live shows on. Ordered a spicy bbq beefburger , i think i get it in like 10 minutes btw was large with fries and salad on the site . Anton, one of the waiters that was serving my table was so helpful, checking if everything was fine all the time ( all the team also ). Show was interesting . Definitely i will come back",,
Went with the family staff were great and food was amazing would highly recommend would definitely go again.,,
Hi guys I want to say we always go here when I’m in Cyprus it’s a great meal with a fantastic live show every night even the hostess owner sings what a amazing voice you have.  Thank you very much for making us feel so welcome and the food is amazing.  Totally recommend you take the time out of your holiday and have a night in here.    Thank you very much guys Andy Annette Salem and Jane.,,
"Thanks so much for the kind hospitality and making our holiday an enjoyable one. We visited three times during our holiday with our three year old daughter and we had an amazing time. The girls made our daughter feel included and made a fuss of her which was lovely. It was lovely to chat to the staff too and see some familiar faces. Please continue to support this great business, especially through these strange times. Thanks again and see you next year.    Compliments to the chef from table 10!",,
"By far, the best place we have eaten since being on holiday. Originally we stayed in the Coral Bay Area but ventured to Pafos a couple of times, on our first time in Pafos we walked past ‘Fat Mamas’ took one look at the menu and fell in love and decided that we had to give it a go! We booked through messaging the Fat Mamas restaurant on FB and they couldn’t have been nicer, my gf who is coeliac asked them about what she would be able to have at the restaurant and they were so quick and helpful with their response! The service was impeccable and everyone was very happy to help, some lovely entertainment with some great dancers, and the food really is to die for. I recommend it going for dinner that you do not eat for 48 hours prior to the meal, because believe me you will be full! Great value for money on both food and drinks, what more could you want?",,
Visited this restaurant many time over the years. Sadly the experience of this week was not great.    Firstly a young guy who was greeting diners thought it was okay to charge up to me and point a temperature gauge at my head which I quickly asked him to desist and point at at my wrist instead.    The waitress was less the helpful and gave no indication on any specials of drinks deals or that a discount was available for cash payment which is poor in my opinion and bordering on being a bit suspect.    The food was way below par. I had fajitas which was basically and small amount of over cooked chicken with a mountain of over cooked peppers and onions.    Between the cries from the staff to the Chef's that compliments from various tables and the constant we've got a birthday in the house or some other celebration bacame a but wearing. Felt like being at a kids birthday party with happy birthday being sang every 10 minutes. I've never known for so many birthdays to be celebrated in the one restaurant.    Definitely won't be back as food was poor and atmosphere left a lot to be desired.    Certainly changed days.,,
"This is the second time i have eaten here. Today we were and to my suprise Stavros Flately was going to perform. I was super excited. Staff is amazing, quick and friendly. Food is amazing we had nachos garlic bread and steak and my baby girl had pizza. Food is delicious. Entertaiment from the girls who come there is amazing. It is worth going 100000%. Best place i have been for a long time!!!! Well done!!!",,
"Really great night at Fat Mamas who are still putting on a fantastic evening, despite restrictions with covid 19. Food was so lovely, service was brilliant and the show as always- just amazing! Stavros Flately was performing on the night we had booked, which added to the entertainment but a truly fantastic evening in a restaurant that remains one of the best in Pafos.",,
I would recommend at least one vist of your holiday to fat mamas excellent food and nice friendly staff and service perfect entertainment put on for everyone many times through the night bit expensive on drinks side but highly recommended,,
We had a fun night at Fat Mamas. Stavros Flatley were performing and it was a good laugh.  It cheered a lot of people up during they’ve uncertain times.  The food was good but if your not a bug eater don’t order a starter as the portions are large.,,
Seriously? Scantily clad young teen girls paraded for your entertainment whilst you try to eat your dinner during Covid times in 2020? We walked away fast. We have daughters and felt that the dance demo was simply tacky and voyeuristic. We couldn't stay.,,
"We decided to visit Fat Mama’s on our last night in Paphos based on the trip adviser reviews. We wish we had done this earlier! The food was the best we had in the fortnight we were in the area. The portions are huge which meant we struggled slightly but we managed perfectly with our order. The potato skins / veggie potato skins were beautiful, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. The hunters chicken was tender and delicious and the halloumi burger was equally as good. My husband said it was the best halloumi he had eaten all the holiday and that includes a Greek restaurant we had eaten in! The entertainment was an added bonus as it’s rare at the moment with the times we are living in. The three dancers were fantastic- every ten minutes they are performing in new outfits every time! The main cabaret show was very entertaining also with some serious gymnastic skills. All this is included at no extra cost. The food prices are reasonable for the area and the quality and freshness of the food is second to none. Next door is Willys steakhouse which shares staff I believe and it appears to be run by an English family. All staff were friendly and welcoming from the doorman / greeter Samson, to the manager / compare lady who made an effort to speak to us, thanking us for supporting them. It really felt our custom was appreciated. We would recommend Fat Mama’s to anyone visiting Paphos. What a place!",,
"Had a wonderful evening at Fat Mamas. We had walked past a few times and saw how packed it was with people enjoying meals, drinks and entertainment. So decided to give it a try and it didn't disappoint. Food was great, atmosphere great and all staff were so friendly. On the evening we were there they had a special guest.... Stavros Flately ! Amazing.",,
We came to this restuarant during our trip to paphos and we were not disappointed. Value for money .. we were surprised at pir meal 2 starters 2 mains 1 pudding 4 cocktals (happy hour) and 3 juices 62€ .. the portion sizes were huge and very tasty. The staff were super friendly and very attentive we enjoyed the entertainment while having our meal. Would 100% recommend.,,
Very friendly staff and good service we had the ribs but unless you're a big eater go small very delicious but salty Had the 3 girls doing their show for a little while the children liked it but wouldn't rush back,,
"Fat Mama's restaurant have been absolutely amazing. From Sanitisation, track and trace details being taken, temperature of all arriving to dine and proper enforcement of social distancing. The food, entertainment and service was excellent. And the portions........ well we have enough for lunch tomorrow as well.",,
"Recently spent two weeks in Paphos and visited Fat Mamma's a few times. Staff are always very friendly and run by an English family.    Love entertainment every night, although same routine. Staff are lovely and always come with humour and very inviting.    Only gripe is with the beef. I'm pretty sure it's not beef. This relates to mainly the bolognase and burgers. You can instantly smell / taste something odd.    Haven't experienced this anywhere else on the island. Interestingly enough, O'Neil's over the road has put 100% British beef on their menu.    Other than that the rest of the food is great, drinks reasonably priced and really good portion sizes.    Overall a lovely place",,
"Went 2 times during our stay in Paphos. The food of the highest quality, great service and super friendly staff. All very well organised. The entertainment was unexpected and very well performed with a touch of humor for good measure. I would recommend this place for sure!",,
"Came here as a group of 26 the night before our wedding. We booked it quite late but they still managed to accommodate us. The staff where great, they did a lovely announcement about us being the first wedding in the area this year due to COVID and explained how happy they were to have us in Cyprus.    The food was fantastic! Really good quality and the portions were HUGE! We all had a starter and main and not one of us managed to finish both courses.    The dancers are also great and give the place a really fun atmosphere.",,
Kind of like a TGi Fridays vibe going on with showgirls dancing every so often etc but nice atmosphere overall. Food was good and quick service would definitely recommend and go again,,
"Fat mamas was the best restaurant that we visited on our holiday. We was greeted by very friendly staff, each had a different roll for seating, drinks , food ect- each one was so lovely and welcoming. The food was tasty and such good portions at very reasonable prices. We received free champagne for our anniversary and a free birthday cocktail which were both great. They have great entertainment, however it’s loud so if you’re looking for a quiet meal this isn’t the place. Never the less, I can’t make one complaint about any of the times we visited.",,
Excellent service Fab food enormous portions Brilliant dancers Owner made us feel Really welcome and advised where to visit on island too,,
The menu keeps it simple but great quality. They are extreamly good on covid checks and even track and trace only place so far and not even mandatory here. The entertainment is definitely a very good added value to go with the meal (how ever I do feel sorry for the dancers with the humidity),,
"Wanted something quick and close to our accommodation. Quality of food and portions good, service ok, entertainment a little weird for a rib shack, young dancing girls doing the can can?? Each to there own I guess. They cater for a certain market, not really me but I wouldn't put people off if you like the sort of holiday camp entertainment. Food is good but two racks of ribs with chips and nothing else got a little boring towards the end. As I say it was good quality, just needed a little coleslaw or something. Very hot on the covid thing but happy to let customers smoke and vape which is a good source of spreading the virus!",,
"Not as busy as previous years but was more relaxed and we enjoyed it better. Food served quickly. My husband and grandson had the ribs which were enormous, I had the Mediterranean Chicken which I really enjoyed. Entertainment was operating as normal. A lovely evening, good food and entertainment, and sat outside in the warm evening air. What joy after all these horrible months with Covid shutdowns.",,
"The best experience from start to finish! I had the fajitas and they were probably the best I’ve had. I highly recommend Fat Mamas, not just for the food but for a night out aswell! The entertainment was insane. Reasonably priced aswell. We was over the moon with the restaurant.",,
"We visited Fat Mamas on our last trip to Cyprus and were not disappointed on this visit.  The potions are still as big as we remember but we decided to share some starters this time. The food was really nice, especially the ribs.  We had a great night, lovely food and good entertainment.",,
fun place to watch a show and enjoy a nice meal.good atmosphere and friendly guests all around.thanks for a great night!!,,
Food was great and they had live music. Only challenge was the table was hard to get and food took a long time. Highly recommend.,,
Really pleasant atmosphere and excellent steak and burgers. The dancers are enthusiastic and very professional,,
"Every time we come to cyprus we make sure we eat here! Delicious food, big portions and cheap! Yummy cocktails too",,
"Food was great, service was fantastic and the drinks were great. Genuine drinks, none of that fobbing us off with fake brands and fake drinks which we experienced in some British bars. Overall, good place the menu is huge so do go with an empty stomach!",,
Very nice meal and friendly staff excellent food excellent service good value for money would recommend,,
Had a meal twice here on a recent visit to Paphos.    Great atmosphere with the staff doing everything they can to make it an enjoyable experience for customers.    The food is good with plenty of choice on the menu.    Good wine list also at reasonable prices.    I had been recommended by a friend and happy to say I wasn't disappointed.,,
We enjoyed a great night at Fat Mammas recently with entertainment from the legendary Stavros Flatley which contributed to the wonderful atmosphere there. Food was excellent quality but almost too much with the large portions served. The staff - both - entertainment and waiting made for a thoroughly memorable experience.,,
"Ate here a few times, massive portions, nachos starter could be a main, lovely food and great entertainment",,
"Great food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere, what more could you ask for. Visited recently as part of a large group and everyone enjoyed our meals. Service was very good and the entertainment was great. Reasonably priced too. We will definitely return if we are back in Paphos.",,
"Been coming many years, always a fun family night, food is delicious, my husband and daughter think steaks are best they’ve had in Cyprus and I think brucetta and cannoli is best I’ve ever had anywhere!! Staff always efficient and friendly. Highly recommend an evening there, it is a really fun night for children, my grandchildren love going, especially for Halloween",,
Went for Halloween. Had large rib rack enough for 4 ordered fries to. Great place to visit. Staff very helpful,,
"Waiter came to our table wearing just a pair of shorts, we could see the waistband of his underpants, his note pad was tucked into them! Totally unacceptable under any circumstances.",,
"Was recommended this restaurant by another holiday maker in our hotel.    The food was lovely and plenty of it, only order the large ribs if you are up for a challenge!!! Entertainment was good fun and it was nice that they celebrated everyone’s special occasions.    Would return again definitely",,
We went here with 2 of our friends the place was very busy but we still managed to get seated pretty quickly after having a drink in the bar. The service was brilliant very friendly waiters/waitresses. There was lots to choose from the menu including vegetarian options all reasonably priced my husband had fillet steak which was only €16.95 he said it was the best steak has ever had I had halloumi fajitas which were very good my friend had the same her husband had ribs the portion of ribs were huge and very good too. The drinks were very good and the entertainment was great caberea acts on during the evening. Highly recommend this place,,
"The Service was great, the entertainment is a bonus for kids, the steak was tender and perfectly cooked and the mushroom and pepper sauces were divine, the ribs were also delicious. sauce",,
"Visited there early Saturday evening and discovered happy hour between 5pm and 7pm meaning if you pay cash for your bill you will get 10% off which we did.  The staff are amazing so helpful cannot do enough for you. The food was plentiful and you most definitely won't go hungry. Plenty of music and entertainment from the staff.  Overall a must and you won't be disappointment, word of warning when it gets busy you will have to queue but the food comes out quickly so shouldn't have to wait to long we didn't.",,
Incredible food and excellent entertainment. Definitely worth a visit. We’ve come to Fat Mama’s more times than I can count. Every time has been amazing. Let the staff know it’s a special day and you’ll definitely get an experience you will never forget!,,
"This must be the 20th or 30th time eating here over the years, and every time is amazing. Beautiful food, stunning waitresses (ok, and waiters) who are incredible at performing. Singing, dancing and service food! I love this place.",,
"Visited here and the whole family loved it, there was amazing food, big portions, small prices, 2 for 1 cocktails and friendly staff and lovely entertainment! What more could you want for an evening. Must visit here!!!",,
Had dinner there last night and was not disappointed with portions sizes ordered a small ribs and was massive which was wonderful. They also come with a side of french fries wife had hunters chicken with the biggest jacket potato ever. It also surprised me that they cater for a gluten free diet and actually understand what it is so hard to find in paphos Cathy Graham was very helpful when I emailed a head and only to pleased to answer any questions I had about the menu amazing customer service . Had a great meal and enjoyed all the memories made also value for money great for families with small children happy visiting when in paphos,,
been here 4 times in 2 visits to Paphos and can't fault it one bit ALL the staff are amazing and can't do enough for you. They make you feel so welcome and relaxed while here and the dancers are really good too. Make sure your hungry as portion sizes are pretty massive and all very tasty although the steak is a must try so tender and juicy,,
"Visited while on holiday and heard very good reviews. They wasn't wrong. We arrived not having made a reservation but was quickly found a table, which was surprising as they was very busy. Drinks and food order taken quickly. Waitress gave good advice and recommendation on our order. Portions large and if honest did put me off my meal as I knew I was beaten before I even started. Entertainment/ dancing girls was great and if you was celebrating a special occasion they come and make a fuss of you. Would visit again if local.",,
Three of us visit this restaurant and it was brilliant. There was a good choice of food and the portions were enormous. We enjoyed the entertainment and also chatting to a couple of the staff who were so friendly.,,
"We visited here after driving past on the way to our hotel and it looked good fun and lively. We werent disappointed. The service was quick and efficient. The food was amazing!! All very tasty and huge servings. My partner had the steak and me the hunters chicken which was yummy. The puddings were equally as good but a bit of a challenge after such a big main. My partner had the banana split and i had the chocolate pancakes, which defeated me! They were scrummy but i couldnt eat it all. The dancing girls were a nice touch and something a bit different. For young girls, they really did put on a great show, something for everyone, and their dancing was really good. They certainly gave our hotel entertainment a run for its money!! Before we left, we got chatting with Layne, the waitress. She was good fun, lovely to talk to and it was a nice touch for her to male the effort and come and speak with us. If we come to Paphos again, we will definately be coming here again. Would highly recommend!",,
We had a meal here for my birthday and the entertainment that came with it was absolutely amazing!! We had a moulen rouge showgirls and Irish dancing as well as a beautiful ballet display. Absolutely fantastic!!! Although the guy participating could have smiled a bit more.. ☹️  Service was super quick and I even had happy birthday sang to me by the dancers with a free cocktail.  Food was outstanding. I had the fajitas and asked for extra jalapeños which was no problem and my husband had the steak. Our friends had the ribs (Wow) they were huge!! And gorgeous. Melted in the mouth..  Toilets were spotless and the food wasn't overly priced.  Definitely child friendly as well.  Very accommodating and top quality.,,
If you want a good night out this is the place to come good food great entertainment all at reasonable prices,,
"We are here last night, fantastic choice on the menu, large portions, very attentive staff, reasonably priced and the dancing girls show too! Highly recommended and we may well be back here again this week 😁",,
"This is somewhere we had to try always packed and cues waiting to get in ( not For long ) service is fantastic staff cannot do enough for you . Entertainment was good fun everyone in the place loved it and joined in . The food was perfect a little on the large side for myself ( couldn’t eat it all ) but my friend and myself really enjoyed the food,the atmosphere and the place . we would highly recommend. Sorry i didn’t get a pic of both mains entertainment was good a real fun atmosphere",,
Great evening out the food and service were excellent. The portions were huge and we were so pleased we listened to the advice of the waitress and got starters to share. Highly recommend eating here. 😀,,
We ate here twice and enjoyed both meals.On one occasion we had pizza and village salad which was delicious.Steak on another occasion which was good. Large portions and nice presentation.We loved the dancers who danced during dinner.Its always busy and people sometimes queue outside.,,
You don't just go to eat it a night of entertainment with the girls and guys putting on a floor show.  Food was fantastic just one tip if your going for the sharing rib starter don't like me and my friend go for a large main course (eyes are bigger than my belly ). If your in Paphos you must visit.,,
Visited this restaurant with 2 friends and we had a great evening. The food is excellent - the chicken fajitas were the best I’ve eaten and huge portions. My friends had the steak and the ribs which were very tasty. The dancers excelled and it was a fun evening. The staff worked so hard and provided excellent service particularly our waitress whom I think was American. There’s no doubt we will be back.,,
"Fantastic restaurant, lovely staff. Very helpful when ordering, for example some of the starters are large so they highlighted this to allow you to think about sharing. Prices were excellent for the quality of the food. My steak was cooked to perfection and was amazingly tender. Ongoing entertainment as you eat. Free and fun so an added bonus. Big show was starting just as we left. The place is clean and the staff clean your table between courses. I cannot fault this place and hope to visit again before we leave. If you're in Paphos I highly recommend you visit this gem of a place.",,
"I went to this restaurant 21 years ago it was good then, even better now. Great staff,great food!! Xx",,
"We went to fat mamas restaurant for a family meal when in Cyprus for a wedding the atmosphere was good prices. ,a. Little on the high side though the steak was lovely and the dancers where excellent on the down side I felt when our order was being taken when asked for just a main course we got told it would take about 25 minutes so we should take a starter to kill the time but as soon as starter was finished our mains came immediately I felt pushed into taking a starter and we should have been told when being seated that there was a wait to be served .",,
"Wow, what a fab restaurant, go very hungry, I thought I’d have the nachos starter as I wasn’t feeling very hungry, it was huge, I only ate a third on the plate. Excellent service",,
"Went here with 2 friends a couple of evenings ago. We all had pasta dishes and enjoyed them very much. I had spaghetti Napolitana with extra chilli - very nice. Also good because they do small and large portions. Lively, fun atmosphere with some entertainment.",,
Ate here one evening and the food was gorgeous. There were 6 of us and all had different meals and were all very pleased with the flavours and presentation however spoilt by the American waitress who lacked customer service skills. this was the only place on our holiday where our custom was not appreciated and the children were not made to feel welcome.,,
"Absolutely excellent from the waiting on staff to the food which is enormous portions and quality to the entertainment, we loved it.",,
"went there for a pizza as a change from the usual greek fare in most eating places. I have never had to waite 35 minutes for one !, maybe chef was on go slow/work to rule ? food was plentyfull but not well cooked, The entertainment was laughable dire, enough to make you eat up quickly and get out !",,
"This restaurant is a must for hungry lovers of all types of food.very good selection,The staff are very friendly & attentive,The entertainment of a night time is first class.totally recommended..",,
"At first we thought it was expensive but it wasn’t myself and my husband shared the “magic mushrooms” to start they wee beautiful. The waiter did say don’t underestimate the starters and he was right I’m glad we shared because when my fajitas came it was huge, really delicious and my husband had a burger again huge we both couldn’t finish them as much as we wanted to. Also the girls come out dancing so that was entertaining and the waiter asked if we were celebrating I mentioned it was my husbands birthday and the girls came our with a birthday hat and a free cocktail with the whole place singing to him so that was really nice. I would really recommend it the food is amazing the staff are great prices were good.",,
"We went here on our first night in paphos, after reading reviews. We were not disappointed, the steak was lovely (and huge!!) I didn't have a starter as I had read about the size of servings but my husband did.....when his rack of ribs came he soon regretted having a starter. When you are given a table they ask if you are there as you are celebrating anything and if you are then you will be sung to and your occasion will be announced by the entertainment team. Great food and great atmosphere.",,
"Joyful evening here, the food is good but the portions are massive,  I had stuffed mushrooms to start which were amazing, then garlic and halloumi pizza, the smaller one and could only eat half of it.  Then the dancers came on, nice touch really enjoyed our evening",,
I had a fillet steak which was cooked to perfection there’s not many places that can do a perfect rare steak it was delicious with chips and salad throughly enjoyed my meal and friendly staff,,
"Fantastic service, first class food, great entertainment, wonderful ambiance, reasonable prices ... what more could you want ? Best steak we have ever had anywhere ! Amazing evening - we look forward to our next visit, thank you Fat Mamma's x",,
"Food is fabulous but portions are much too big. Starters are size of normal main course and mains are immense!! Big menu - a little confusing that you get a menus for two restaurants and can choose from either. Fabulous burgers, fajitas, potato skins etc. Only disappointment was a prawn cocktail but forgiven. Staff excellent and entertainment from dancers every evening make the atmosphere a little different from other restaurants in the area. All in all, a great choice and certainly one to try on your holiday!!",,
"Excellent Restaurant, Great service food was outstanding we ate here 7 nights out of our 10 night holiday and never has a bad meal, portion sizes were excellent, Great atmosphere. Would highly recommend.",,
"The food was really good. very helpful, kind and friendly staff. Beautiful environment, full of music and a very nice show.😊",,
"Very nice food, comfortable place, staff very nice, kind e really friendly. I’ve been in Cyprus for one week and I didn’t eat so good nowhere like here.",,
We went there 3 times the staff were very polite and fast the food was brilliant and you even get free entertainment thrown in no complaints at all. very happy,,
Mother of Christ if you go to Cyprus you have to visit this place. We were not expecting dinner and a show it was gas and food was drool worthy! Staff are all so lovely too!,,
"We were warned to arrive early to avoid the queues, to have an empty stomach and to avoid the large portions unless the dog wants feeding too. All of the above is true! The staff greeted us at the door and sat us in an already busy side of the restaurant, despite it only being early. We were told the difference between cowboy Willy’s and fat Mamas and left to make our selections. Stupidly, my partner mentioned that it was my birthday...  As our drinks arrived the queue at the door was already 10 deep, so book a table if you can’t be bothered waiting.  I ordered the small ribs (they were massive) and my partner had the lasagne (only comes in 1 size - humongous). Both were nice.  Then the entertainment began; 3 stunning dancers put smiles on everyone’s faces as they did the first of about 6 2 minute ‘mini shows’. I was treated to a world of embarrassment (I loved it really) being singled out as the birthday boy by the entertainers.  Thank you for the mocktail and the novel evening!",,
A kind of American themed diner menu serving a range of foods.  The burger was huge....only eat here if you are hungry!  Excellent service well priced with lovely staff.worth a try if on holiday you won't be disappointed.  Also there is a stunning show on while you eat.,,
"Great restaurant which caters for all, be aware, it is busy and you may have to queue, however, it is worth the wait",,
Food was exeptional staff and service brilliant everyone has a personnal exprrience mine could not have been better memories of 13 years ago exceeded,,
Great portions- friendly staff and buy one get one free on gorgeous cocktails when dining early- a lovely restaurant,,
"We stopped by and both had a burger. Really enjoyed them and cocktails were two for one as we visited between 6-7pm. The entertainment was a little bit random, but still, was something a bit different from other restaurants. We thought the price was really really good (under 40€ for two huge burgers with chips, salad, four cocktails and water).",,
"The food was amazing, the entertainment was good fun and it was one of the standout places we visited during our holiday.",,
"Had a lovely meal at fat mama's,the service is excellent with entertainment from the staff they serve big portions so choose small portions if your not a big eater",,
Nice atmosphere with big portions but taste was average. Also we waited more than an hour to be seated. So reserve before you go as the place is really packed.,,
"We had two excellent meals at this restaurant. They offer 2 menus which you can pick and choose from. The staff were brilliant, very welcoming and there was great entertainment. Great for kids too. A must if you visit Pathos.",,
"Meaning to visit this restaurant for years, maybe been put off buy very loud music and dance, but tonight there was no entertainment so we decided to try the cuisine. Ordered peppered fillet rare, and lasagna, both meals arrived quickly and cooked to perfection.",,
"We went first time, good food and great service, with good entertainment show, and decided to come again, but we was disappointed about the service and quality of the food. So they are not constant, not returning",,
"Nice food and drinks , but unfortunately the show didn't last long , loved the variety and quality of food and waiters/waitresses always there for you",,
"Fat Mama's was recommended to us by a friend, and it didn't disappoint. The food was excellent quality (the ribs especially fantastic!), the atmosphere and level of service was outstanding. For such a busy restaurant, you expect the service and quality of food to suffer, but staff were very attentive and the quality of food was delicious. It was my Birthday when we visited and they made it very special - thank you!",,
"Went to Fat Mama's on a recommendation and wow the food was amazing. The portions were American portions, burgers huge and varied options and the ribs, a kids portion had 9 ribs. Offers 2 for 1 on Carlsberg bottles 5pm- 6pm and 2 for 1 cocktails between 6-7  Lovely dancers and singers start about 7 pm    Had the pleasure of Stavros Flatley drop in and take the time for photos with my son",,
"The best service, great food good family venue, went for a meal with a party of 20 the night after our sons wedding, the staff were friendly my son and wife got a small bottle of champagne and an announcement from the staff, it was a prefect evening, there was face painting for the kids, singing and dancing by the girls working there. What can I say, definitely visit it's worth every euro.",,
"The atmosphere in here is amazing. The staff are so welcoming! The toilets are abit over the top decorated but hey ho. Having the dancers there and the food staff involved was great it gave that friendly welcome apart from one of the dancers falling over, it was the best night i had in Cyprus and we only came once but the food was out of this world. So beautiful! Massive compliments to the chef!",,
"Fun, vibrant venue - friendly/attentive team, live entertainment and huge good quality food at great prices.",,
The staff here are the best on the island... They really know how to help you have a great meal/time with them.,,
Went to this place twice and wow the food was amazing the portions was really plenty too singing and dancers keep you entertained while having your meal 2 for 1 cocktails between 6-7 and they are lovely definitely be returning.,,
"Big portions of American type food, the do Mexican too if I remember  Do not order a starter for yourself, you can easy share them between 2 or 3. I was disappointed as my burger was so huge I didn't have it in me for dessert  Some incredible dancing ladies there which seemed to keep the dads happy, and a handsome dancing chappie if you prefer.  All very tasteful though",,
"Ordered an appetizer platter that had bbq ribs, wings, potato skins and nachos. Thinking we would order a main after that...didn't happen...massive platter was more than enough for 3 people! Everything was tasty! Great service and very reasonable prices! Will definitely return!",,
Yet again one amazing place been here three times now excellent food and very friendly the food is absolutely unbelievable you will not be disappointed thanks fat mamas brilliant x,,
"Visited here whilst on our holiday. We were all inclusive but had read great reviews of this place so we decided to make a visit while we were visiting the harbour.    We wasnt disappointed we did arrive early so didnt need to queue, the guy who greeted us explained all the offers they had on, which I thought was brill as we may not have spotted it was 2-4-1 drinks. The kids got a colouring sheet and pencils to keep the occupied, as I had looked at the reviews on here I knew the options were huge so we shared a starter. The ribs were devine aswell as the steak. I couldn't finish the small ribs (2racks) there was just so much! The dancers came out and did a little dance and then went over to a table who was celebrating a special occasion which I thought was a lovely touch. Overall this was the best meal we had whilst on holiday we got 10% off the bill as we ate before a certain time. Would highly recommend and will return when we next visit paphos.",,
"We are here a couple of times during our stay and I have to say we were not disappointed on either occasion. The food was lovely and the portions were HUGE.  They have a cabaret type show at 9pm and most nights there is a queue to get in.  My advice would be either book, or go early or go after 9:30pm.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed",,
"Me and my boyfriend visited this restaurant after many recommendations from people staying at our hotel. We were nearby at Damon Apartments which was about 10 min walk. And it did not disappoint! Friendly welcome and nice open area with plenty of seating. There is a lot of choice on the menu from pizzas to burgers, from salads to pasta. And decent prices at around €12 a meal. When the food came it looked excellent, plentiful and piping hot. I ended up taking 2 slices of my pizza back with me. They do excellent drinks deals and cocktails. During our visit it was 241 Heineken between 5 and 6pm and 241 cocktails between 6 and 7pm. I would highly recommend a meal here to anyone I know visiting the area.",,
The menu choice is great loads to choose from. Waitress was great. (Waiters need to smile) when food came out they were huge portions. Husband said the steak tasted great. I had chicken fajitas which was really good. Highly recommended,,
"We recently visited here after reading good reviews and when we arrived it looked really good. We got seated and then we had a really rude American woman taking our order, we asked if we could have separate bills as there was 12 of us and was told we couldn't and was told they haven't done separate bills for over 25 years. The portions were huge but the food was quite expensive, every meal seemed to be covered in the same sauce which was like a really tangy BBQ sauce which was even inside the burgers. We waited nearly an hour for our food and every time during our meal that we needed extra drinks we would be waiting for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. When it came to paying the same rude American lady would ask for a tip every time she put an amount in the card machine. I would definitely not eat here again.",,
On the first day of the holiday we walked past the restaurant and saw a large queue so presumed it was good. We found out the queue was because they took forever to sit you and even longer to give you a menu. After that you had to ask one waitress for drinks and another one for food. Eventually we got served and the cocktails where bland and tasteless. The pizza was the worse thing I have ever tasted. Overall a massive disappointment will never return,,
"This was a surprise birthday meal for my son in law Dom. And we had prebooked it the day before as we had heard that it gets really busy as there is entertainment throughout the evening. When we got there we were shown our seats given menus and told that cocktails were 2 for 1 up until 7pm and also if we paid cash then we would get 10% discount. I have to say the kids meals we ordered ( pizzas ) were very big. I had a burger, it was huge, but oh my goodness it was so good. My wife had steak as did Dom and my daughter and my other daughter had chicken. Everyone said how good the food is and also the staff were amazing. The entertainment was excellent with the Fst Mamas dancers and one of the Waitresses is the singer, she had an amazing voice.    Dom was even treated to a free drink and sung Happy Birthday to with the Fat Mamas dancers.  This restaurant was so good we went back for another meal another night.  I would like to say a big thank you to this place for everything they did for us.",,
We took a trip down from our hotel to visit Fat Mamas just from word of mouth in our hotel. It is next door to Willy's Ribs as well and you get the choice of both menus once inside. We were told that beyond 8pm you may have to queue and we did but were seated within 5 minutes.    The food was plentiful and the menu does offer a 'lesser portion' for those that don't want/need the bigger dinners on certain items.    During the meal there was a short cabaret show of sorts. It was an enjoyable addition to an already greta meal,,
"Fat Mama's is one of the best restaurants around Paphos region, the only downside is waiting time to enter, however food and atmosphere is excellent.",,
The rudeness we received from this restaurant is absolutely atrocious.  We waited over 45 minutes for our food and was told ‘ sorry it is busy’ and was told we would need to wait an extra 25 minutes baring in mind this was what we was told prior to ordering the food.  One staff member dropped plates and cut somebody’s leg.  I would highly recommend eating elsewhere if you are with a big group like we was.,,
"Can't praise this place enough, was gutted we waited until the 2nd week of our holiday to visit but went 4 times. The portion sizes are gigantic but decent quality at a really low prices, I had a childs spag bol and it was bigger than any adult one I've had in the UK.  It's very loud as there was live entertainment which we all loved especially the children, drinks are a good price also and the staff were brilliant and very accommodating which was great as a family with young children.  Highly recommended, amazing value, fantastic atmosphere, convenient location. 10/10",,
"A great family restaurant that gets packed out every night & there's a good reason for that...Its fantastic! Live entertainment, great food for everyone that's very reasonable & some arcade machines for the kids to play on. The service is brilliant & all the staff work alongside each other which is how it should work & does!! Our waitress was lovely and made sure that the Gluten Free option for my wife was double checked before we ordered. Loads to choose from & of course I just had to go for the Cowboy Ribs..I managed to get through them as I was particularly hungry that day but just warning you folks that they are big! Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is in this area of Paphos",,
"Wow! We had a great night at Fat Mama’s! Every aspect was excellent from the food to the service and the entertainment. The management team clearly know how to organise a busy restaurant and keep staff happy, everyone was so friendly and welcoming! My son said the ribs were the best he has ever eaten!!",,
We enjoyed a great night here whilst on holiday in Paphos.    We visited in the hope to see Stavros Flatley but unfortunately it didn’t turn up during our 2 hour visit. We ordered starters and main course whilst we were there - all food was really tasty and nice size portions.    We defo visit again!,,
"We escaped the all inclusive buffet hall for a night here after a recommendation and we weren’t disappointed! There was so much choice and all our meals were fabulous. The starters are huge so I’d recommend sharing these! Lovely atmosphere and some entertainment too. Despite being really packed, the staff were on the ball and attentive! Highly recommended!",,
Absolutely perfect the place is lovely the staff are always smiling and helpfull the service 100% spot on the food mmmmmm gorgeous if we wern't in a 5* all inclusive hotel we be there every night { foods 10 times better the the hotel opps sorry } and the entertainment brilliant very well done to all who work at fat mamas. hope to pop in once more on Tuesday before we go home next week xx keep up the good work guys,,
"Fabulous food & service. Staff are very friendly and attentive. We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated as the restaurant was very busy but it was definitely worth the wait.  I chose garlic stuffed mushrooms to start & my partner went for the cheesy garlic bread, both were delicious.  For mains I chose the BBQ ribs which came with chips. Warning... the portions are huge so only opt for the cowboy-sized ribs if you have a large appetite! The BBQ sauce was delicious and the meat was so tender and fell off the bone.  My partner chose the cheese and bacon burger which he thoroughly enjoyed.  The entertainment is a nice little touch too. If you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary, let the staff know then you get a free drink!  We will definitely be returning before we go back home as the sizzling plates and fajitas looked great too",,
"Well where do i start,lots of tables and a good menu with lots of choices,every now and then dancers apear to entertain you.DO NOT walk past this resturant the food is excellant and plenty of it.",,
Decided to eat out from our allocated and chose this venue based solely on Tripadvisor Reviews.  I must say we weren’t disappointed fantastic meals had by the 4 of us and our youngest can be a bit fussy when it comes BBQ Ribs they have to bang on every time and he’s only 10yrs old well the look on his face when two racks of Ribs came out smothered in BBQ sauce and this was the small portion the normal was huge from what we saw going to other diners.  Cut a long story short the staff were brilliant even had a glass of Bubbly each as we were asked what was there any special occasion we were dining out for food superb amazingly quick delivery from ordering to eating top marks all round 10/10,,
"Staff so friendly & helpful nothing too much trouble. Food was absolutely amazing melt in your mouth steak, n wow fajitas unbelievably generous portions & taste delicious- (happy hour 5-7pm with cocktails 2 for 1) Entertainment was fantastic had such a fabulous night booked again for our 28th Anniversary On Saturday, Even had a pic with Stavros Flatley.  5* restaurant worth 5 mins queue to get in Highly recommended",,
Best restaurant in area. Best portions and best value - no wonder there are queues outside every night. Recommend beef fajitas.,,
Highly recommend but we asked for small portions which we’d never normally do as the portions are Huge! We were made aware before our visit phew!! Gorgeous steaks Filet at Fantastic prices and entertainment by the Team which made for a fantastic atmosphere! Thank you one of our favourites visited twice during our stay,,
"Service very good, portion sizes are enormous - I had the “small” ribs, which was two racks! Great dancing and singing acts were an added bonus.",,
Really good food. Good service and excellent value for money. Think it was cheapest meal we had within a 2 week holiday.. returning for our last night..,,
I've been to this restaurant several times and it never disappointed once. Food is only beaten by the service and you can't say that in many places...it's outstanding from start to finish...then add the beautiful dancers...a mix never to be forgotten. If you visit paphos without a visit here...shame on you ! The fat Mama's ribs ..wow ...good luck with trying to finish them...,,
Ate here every other night and was amazing food.Portion sizes are very large but food is delicious. Great staff and entertainment while you eat. Highly recommended.,,
"We were recommended to visit Fat Mama’s and it didn’t disappoint. The food was superb, plenty of choice and portion sizes were good value for money. The star of the show though is Cathy and the entertainers, they were brilliant throughout the night constantly changing outfits and performing for the packed out restaurant. We would highly recommend a visit...probably best to starve yourself for the day though to get the most out of the portions",,
"My kids (particularly my 8 year old) really liked Fat Mamas. The food came in generous portions (small ribs would be called large anywhere else!) The dancing and singing was fun. The variety of menu choice is good. You can get 10% off your bill and 2 for 1 on cocktails if you arrive before 7pm. The menu included burgers, pizza, pasta, fajitas (yum!), ribs, chicken, salads, etc. etc. There are a few things preventing a higher star rating. The silly queues (not that we did queue as we were there early) but people were queuing down the street from about 7pm onwards and there were plenty of empty tables. If they had 2 people greeting at the entrance they could clear the queue in the street faster (although maybe the kitchens can't cope?). It isn't that amazing it is worth queuing for it feels like an artificial way to look more popular. The service was somewhat impersonal. There were a lot more friendly family run restaurants nearby where the locals were more interactive, interested in you and gave you bread/iced water/a warm welcome/a free drink/desert etc. No friendly and warm homely feel about Fat Mamas but the food was nice.",,
"Had a brilliant night here for my granddaughters 4th birthday. We didn’t queue for to long for a table. Staff were great and service was quick for drinks and our order. We all had a varied selection off the menu and everyone was very pleased. Food was delicious and very large portions. The highlight is the entertainment, three brilliant dancers who also do little routines for any birthdays. They made a such a fuss of Grace who really loved the attention. The bill at the end was a surprise as it excellent value for money. Would definitely recommend a night out here.",,
"most nights you have to que to get a table here but there are many better restaurants on the same road .yes the portions are large and you get entertained but the quality of the food in my experience is average at best .my wife sent her main course back because it was cold and my steak was cremated when i asked for it medium well so that got returned as well .all in all a poor meal and we didnt return over our 2 week holiday,the worst meal we had .",,
"Excellent service, great value for money . Cocktails buy one get one free Ideal for birthday celebrations etc Need to book otherwise there are queues",,
"Apart from the queuing to get in even though we booked a table, the experience was very good. Not somewhere we would normally eat but needed somewhere to help keep the kids entertained. That they most certainly did, not only with their entertainment and arcade but with their tasty and varied menu. every one of us (8 visitors) enjoyed our food but only a few could finish, The portions are more than generous. Some places you go this affects the quality, not here !! Staff also very friendly..",,
Was there last week for an evening meal with family. This place really does work well with their whole setup. Food portions are big but still tasty. Staff are friendly and service is prompt. Entertainment was nice to have inbetween courses. The restaurant has added its own little personal touch which is nice.,,
"Bruschetta was huge, but basic, wings plentiful and mushrooms as described- served quick, lots of staff.    Entertainment was very good - they work really hard.    Ribs - small were again huge. Chicken fajitas were huge as was the salad - had to ask for wraps which came, then had to wait for dips - boss lady came over and apologised very professionally and offered to heat it all up again - no need.    Whilst service was slightly dodgy, I think this was rare. Very professional resulted in a 10% tip still.    Food was plentiful- you won’t go hungry, burgers looked enormous. It won’t be your most sophisticated meal, but you won’t go there for that.",,
"This restaurant is fun , the food is nice They have an American and Italian menu so something for everyone. The dancing is fun to watch and makes for an entertaining evening Worth a visit but be prepared to queue even when you have booked",,
In 2005 we stayed in a hotel on a bed & breakfast deal being the first time in Cyprus and one evening decided to go to Fat Mammas for a meal. I have to say that it was the best meal I had in years the quality and size of the meal was superb. We have been to Cyprus many times since and have always recomended Fat Mammas to friends we made during our visit to Cypus.,,
"I don't think we knew what to expect but had seen the queues outside on a few nights so thought we would try it .... we had a good night, the cocktails were lovely and the food was good, very American In style but the burger was yummy and was huge! The entertainment was fun, bonkers and enjoyable and the restaurant was busy every night with a mixture of young and old.",,
"Great entertainment, be sure to tell them of birthdays or anniversaries as you get a mention and a free drink. Fast service and I mean fast! They have people queued out the door to get in so they turn tables. We got here for 7pm the last time you can book tables. Food delicious and desserts out of this world. Will be back next year for sure.",,
"We visit Big Fat Mamas every year when we travel to Paphos, always lovely food, huge portions and great atmosphere, looking forward to next yea, the only tip is get there early!",,
Always a firm favorite when people are over being resident in paphos.    You sometimes to have to wait for a table but it’s worth it.    Unless your starving opt for the small portions highly recommend ribs. The burgers are massive !!    Excellent service entertainment as well.    Well priced and if you’ve got room try a pudding.,,
"We went here for my nieces birthday party. We knew it was good as we have eaten here in the past. The food is always good and plentiful with entertainment thrown in. We had a variety of adults and kids meals, I had cowboy ribs which were far too much for me to manage. The food is always piping hot and is served in reasonable time. I would recommend this place to absolutely anybody",,
The restaurant has an Italian menu and an American menu so caters for all. Average cost but good food and portions. They have live dancers to provide a bit of entertainment.,,
Really great atmosphere and the meal sizes are huge its definitely a man v food type place. Food and drink is brilliant. Would recommend this place 100%,,
"A great place if you have young-ish children as they are kept entertained by the dancers. The singer, who also waits at tables has a fantastic voice and I wish she sang more. It's something that's a bit different and no other restaurant offers this sort of entertainment.  The food was great and tasty and the portions are huge!",,
"Good food, very large portions, my advice would be to share starters. Italian and American style food so not the place to sample the local cuisine but plenty of choice.",,
"We loved the food, the dancers and the staff. What an amazing evening we had, lots of happy customers and staff it was a really great atmosphere and we loved everything about it. There was a short wait due to the place being full but we were swiftly seated and served and were thoroughly happy with the service we received! Thanks guys xx",,
Visited this place whilst on holiday in Paphos. They make you queue outside for ages despite having numerous tables available (I think it’s to make it appealing) food was ok & reasonably priced. The dancers are a nice addition but think they could be so much better if they had appropriate choreography.,,
Love this restaurant and have done for the many years we’ve travelled to Cyprus. It never disappoints. Even though we were all inclusive we still visited twice and it didn’t disappoint. Food was amazing. Service was amazing. And the dancers were amazing. Not a bad word to say about fat mamas. Regular dancing and singing. Be warned portions are huge.,,
We have been to this restaurant on a number of occasions throughout the years and it still is just as good. The food portions are huge and the entertainment is brilliant will definitely return again,,
"This place gets busy after 7 so you may have to wait to get in - we had a 10/15 minute wait when we went.    Greeted by a very pleasant and apologetic host who showed us to our table. Service staff very quick to take our drinks order and deliver them.    Myself and my 10 year old son ordered burgers and my wife chose fajitas - when it arrived, we could not believe the portion sizes. Huge is an understatement. Nice food followed by entertainment of a 15 minute dance show by three UK girls and a special guest dancer, which considering the floor space available, was actually quite good (and I usually hate that sort of entertainment). It may not be Ellen's Stardust Diner but a very good effort nonetheless.    I wish that you could give half ratings on TA, as this was a 3.5 really",,
Went for my husband's birthday as we do every year and was not disappointed. Lovely meal cooked to perfection and nice friendly staff,,
"We ate here twice during our holiday. The food was excellent. The portion sizes are extremely generous. I would highly recommend the chili nachos and chicken fajitas. The chocolate cake is to die for, again massive portion size. Tasty strawberry daiquiris. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Great atmosphere. I would highly recommend this restaurant",,
"Love fat mamas first came here 19 years ago and just gets better every time we come to Cyprus. Great for birthdays and big groups, visited as group of 13 and a family of 4. Massive portions, husband couldn’t finish the ribs this year. Entertainment is a nice touch and the lady who runs it is really lovely. Can’t go wrong visiting here! Will definitely visit next year when we come Back to Cyprus x",,
"First time we visited here just me and my wife. We had scampi and nachos for starters and Rattlesnake steak and chicken salad for mains . Second time we brought the kids we had the ribs and fajitas. Kids had pasta and chicken strips, everyone enjoyed the food and excellent service. The ribs are the best I’ve ever had will definitely come back !",,
"Dined here one evening, I had the ribs and the wife had steak. Luckily we didn't order starters because the portions are huge. Very nice food, tidy cocktails and they have entertainment through the evening, singing and dancing. Would recommend a visit.",,
"WOW this is how it should be done, Fat Mama's should open a training school for others, first time here was 12 years ago and after 12 years it has only went and stayed the same amazing place, really cannot say enough deserves 10*  The staff make you feel important and very welcome, the food well it is mouth watering so good we went twice in one week :)  Until next time Fat Mama's keep up the good work you guys are diamonds",,
First time visit to Cyprus  Visited 4 times during 11 day stay  Fantastic Food  We tried various dishes  Everyone cooked to perfection  Superb taste and portions  Two for one cocktails  10% discount before 7  Excellent atmosphere and a touch of class from the Dancers  They do not cut corners on Staff to who were very helpful and looked after everyone  It was like a theatre show  Front of house management excellent  And credit to the chefs who often get overlooked as they are behind the scenes well done to them to  A very well managed touch of class  Take it from me well worth a visit  Well done all the team,,
"Wow ! Just wow ! Friendly service and the food was amazing and the portions were that big we had to ask for take out boxes! This restaurant is a must visit when in paphos, would use again and recommend to family and friends",,
We visited this restaurant twice during our stay in Paphos. It’s child friendly and has a huge menu. The portions are enormous so choose wisely! There’s some entertainment thrown in too....it’s very popular so expect a little wait to be seated. Super night out!,,
"Visited here after being recommended to us, and wasn’t let down. The food was gorgeous and very reasonably priced for 5. Have a choice of small or large portions but small was ample. Great cocktails and the atmosphere was great, even with random dancing & singing made it all part of the experience. Would highly recommend booking as got very busy from 7.30 onwards with people waiting. Will be going back before holiday ends",,
"Good food, friendly staff, just don’t have starters & a main unless you’re starving!!!! Simple entertainment- good for young children",,
"We went back to Fat Mama's yet again (every year we come to Cyprus we return) - it's our children favourite restaurant and an essential visit whilst in Paphos. We also combine this with my middles son's birthday treat.    Welcoming staff, a varied menu, entertainment for all ages. It is also competitively priced.    Take no notice of the moaners - this place is great. The ribs; fajitas; king prawns are great and the children's portion sizes are huge!    Thanks again to Fat Mama's for another memorable night. See you again next year :)",,
So far so good ... good entertainment. Food was okay. Good staff. . Fun a place to be in.good music good location.,,
We had been to Fat Mamas on previous holidays to Paphos. The children enjoyed the entertainment so decided to revisit. Food is distinctly average and over priced. Entertainment is very Butlins like but kids under 10 will enjoy. Food became infested with insects about halfway through the meal. When I mean infested I mean hundreds of insects from the flowers at the front of the restaurant. We called the manager over who was rude and obnoxious. She told us that this is an outside venue and to expect insects. I told her the odd fly is natural not hundreds of beatles. Very poor and refused to remake food or provide a discount. Avoid for your own health. Much better restaurants in the area.,,
"So....the place was very busy which usually means good food and good service, had a Pizza, wasnt bad but not the best i have had, cant grumble for 10 euro.  The music was all over the place and hardly allowed a song to run through before 3 girls skip out dancing.    Not the knd of place to go if you dont like haven/butlinsesque entertainment while eating your food, not for me but i am sure others that like this kind of thing would really enjoy it. The only thing that was missing was Stephen Mulhern with a pack of cards lol",,
"I took fish seabass and it was sweet like desert- didt like, the paparoni pizza was ok...the chocolate fudge was not good, just a big dry chocolate cake. The stuff is really nice.",,
First came here in 2008 with family. Been back several times since and it never disappoints.  The food portions are huge. You get your absolute monies worth.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  The ribs are unreal.  The entertainment is always class.  You can’t visit paphos without coming here.,,
"Came to fat mamas on my birthday and what a delight it was. I told the doorman it was my birthday and I got given a free cocktail. Good service and delicious food, I totally recommend this place! It has everything you can think of on their menu",,
Was recommended to go here by friends - great meal with food entertainment. Portion sizes were huge! We bought 1 pizza to share between 2 of my boys but it could have fed all 3 of them! We all left feeling very stuffed! Arrived during happy hour which was for cocktails and mock tails so the boys had double drinks too....only slight annoying thing was the amount of bugs that came out at night and were just falling on us and our food.,,
"Definitely worth a visit if in Paphos. Get there early though as there is usually a queue to get in.    Great value, very family/young child friendly, extensive Italian / American menu. Nice friendly staff and a unique atmosphere. Yes it’s very touristy and the cabaret is a bit cheesy but it’s great fun and entertaining - our kids loved it.",,
Fantastic food served here nice location and lovely staff who look after your every need give it a go and go large on the meals very filling and the entertaiment is good aswell....😎👍,,
great food an loads of it . an the entertainment is great to go along with the 2 for 1 cocktails. staff are all happy to help an friendly,,
"We always visit this place when we stay in Paphos, the atmosphere is great, the staff are lovely, and the food is delicious! Portion sizes are massive, you defiantly get your moneys worth here! Will be returning in future!",,
"The food here was tasty and all, but the place and the general experience is very average. The portion sizes are way too big, creates unnecessary food waste. The dancing performances were a bit too much (felt like there was a mini show every 5 minutes.",,
"We went here on our first evening in Paphos and thought it was fantastic.    The staff were very welcoming, they had dancers come out and perform a number of dances, the menu was huge with something for everyone (even my fussy 14 year old)    Portion sizes were very good, we thoroughly enjoyed the evening and are hoping to get there again before we leave to go home.",,
Always a favourite of ours as a family of 4. Entertainment is brilliant. A bit of eye candy for the dads and the kids love the dancing. We always get a doggy bag as the portion size is huge. Every time we visit Cyprus for two or three weeks we try to get two visits in here as it's very nice.,,
"Having read the reviews we where looking forward to visiting . While the food was decent it wasn't excellent, i think people get excited about big portions rather than good quality our teenage kids said burgers were big but dry and not tasty i had small portion of ribs again nice but not amazing im 6ft and 14 stone and it was plenty mojito was awful was disappointing the dancing was english/American not a hint at amy local cultre wasnt a bad night but dont think we would go again",,
"We were recommended to come here by others,  Had a genuinely good night. Food was good (don’t think you are coming to a Michelin star restaurant) it’s a American/Italian style restaurant with large portions, good food, fun entertainment which all added up to a great night out with friends.  From what I can gather you can book between 5pm and 7pm and then it’s a first come first served basis. The restaurant has many seats so I think it will be pretty quick moving.  If you arrive/book before 7pm then you are offered 10% off invoice but you must pay cash and all cocktails are 2 for 1.  We were served by a slightly non charismatic American woman who certainly wasn’t full of smiles to start, although as the evening went on she let her guard down and managed a few smiles and laughs!!! I reckon she may have been the owner and whilst I understand not everyone is the same I think it’s important if you are meeting/greeting and seating people you should smile a little more...but don’t worry we will be back!!  Service overall was perfectly ok, the attention levels were higher at the start and I think when the staff realise your not going to vacate your table straight after food then they tend to leave you alone and concentrate on others, which was perfectly acceptable.  The dancers/entertainers were really good fun with a wide mix of little shows throughout the evening and a little 15 min show towards the end.  Definitely worth a visit, probably the more the merrier and after a few cocktails it’s makes for a genuinely good nights fun..,",,
What can I say this place is fantastic!! The food is brilliant and the entertainment is second to non!! All the staff are friendly and really helpful!! We both had a burger and couldn’t move after we had eaten it!!  Well done everyone keep up the good work!,,
"Fat Mama's offers you a choice of menus, either Italian or American but, above all else, it offers an entertaining evening. Dancers take to the floor throughout the evening and then, at 9 pm, they offer a cabaret show! Great dancers and a surprise to be found in the waiting staff, too.  The food is good, too, which made for a great evening.  Recommended.",,
We visited it on a Thursday night they had a nice show. The plates are very delicious and big portions.,,
The food is good value for money as the portions are huge. So if you don't have a big appetite then I would suggest just have the main course. The large rib portion is the biggest I have ever seen. Would probably feed three. The entertainment throughout the meal is very good quality and will keep the children amused. The only down side is that it is that you have to queue up for a table especially at the weekend. So get there early. There is even a chance that you may have a sighting of the famous Stavros flatley as he is a friend of the owner. All in all a good family evening out but too noisy if you are looking for a quiet meal.,,
"Staying close to Fat Mamas was a real bonus as we visited this excellent restaurant four times while on our hols, from the huge Burgers to the very tasty pasta dishes everything my wife and I eat was great, with entertainment (dancing girls)..every 10 minutes and the great service what more could you ask for, would definitely recommend to couples and families alike.",,
"Very popular restaurant . Booked a table and got a friendly welcome , Swift and very friendly service . Food is plenty , the burgers are big and excellent cooked . We had some starters and different main courses - all very good . They have two menus , American and Italian - lots of food to choose from . It’s a quite noisy restaurant , show is going on and around the guests so don’t expect a quiet dinner ... but you can expect plenty of excellent food , served by very friendly staff .",,
"This place is a must, the service was outstanding, very happy and welcoming. The food is amazing, we all enjoyed our meals, the portion sizes are big so make sure you're very hungry, would definitely eat here again. 😊",,
"I've been visiting Fat Mama's two or three times a year for twenty years now. It's always been a great place to eat........... until this time. I'm so disappointed at what I found.    1. Waiting time:- There were two tables for 2 free at the time of our arrival but instead of being seated we were sent to the bar at the back. After one round of drinks (I imagine that was the reason for sending us there, extra income) we were directed to one of those empty tables. Why couldn't we just go there anyway. It was clean and re-set and nobody else was waiting.    2. Waiter:- We had a young lad come to the table who mumbled some intelligible nonsense that only dogs would be able to hear. He looked dishevelled and couldn't even stand upright. I have seen people with his appearance before but only whilst watching Trainspotting!    3. Ambience:- This place used to be buzzing with staff rushing around enthusiastically attending to everyone's needs. Music played and dancing girls celebrated personal anniversaries etc. Shouts of compliments going to the kitchen etc. The ambience along with the staff was lacklustre.    4. Waiting times after ordering:- No problems here, as good as always.    5. Food:- Now, if you've been there several times then you'll know this about the food here - Great quality, big portions. Sadly, this wasn't the case. I ordered a dish I've had several times before. There was only 1/2 the amount there always used to be and it had very little flavour. Geronimo would be very disappointed.    6. Feeling wanted:- Normally in a visit here I would be asked if everything is okay etc. at least three or four times. On this visit I was spoken to twice. Once to take my order and once to pay the bill. I felt invisible.    7. Dancers:- Any visit to Fat Mama's is always topped off by the short Showtime event at the end of the night. The dancers have always been excellent doing some good routines with vigour and good choreography. Dancers in time with each other, great costumes and a show that flowed. Not this time! Really lifeless performance, out of sync with each other and when zombie the waiter turned up to lift one of the girls it had all the grace of a builder lifting his hod up the scaffolding. Although that might be a bit unfair to scaffolding. It was truly awful. The lady that owns this place has always taken great pride in getting good dancers and producing good routines down the years. She would have been devastated to see this. They really let her down.    Synopsis:- I know the economy is difficult in Cyprus right now, especially with the hotels and their 'all inclusive' offers, and this has probably had to lead to some economising and shrink-flation but this was ridiculous. It seems to me that some basic 'care' has gone from the way things are done now. I've no idea what the cause is but I do know this. Reputation is built over a period of years and is destroyed in weeks when you take your eye off the ball. I really hope the couple that run the restaurant re-focus their attention on it and give quite a lot of people quite a big kick up the backside. Paphos with Fat Mama's wouldn't be the same but if they don't get their act together again soon it will only be a matter of time.    I will return again soon and would hope to see a massive improvement. I'll probably come back again next year too................if it's not too late!",,
This place was incredible. We were all inclusive in our hotel however had dinner here twice as it was so lovely. Food is amazing and you get so much! Staff are very friendly and the entertainment is brilliant! Cabaret show in particular! Would definitely recommend and if I ever return to paphos we will make sure to visit again :) :),,
We are family of 4.visiting you very often! We english cypriot! The food is was almost the same than other years. Good and quick.. Show even better! I will mention only the staff unprofessional attitude! Young and careless! Missed the old days.. Missed Maria back,,
"What can I say... excellent food,staff and entertainment is great.has to be the best restaurant in paphos by far",,
"Over our 11 day stay in Paphos we visited here for dinner on 3 occasions. The first 2 were excellent - good service, good entertainment and fantastic food. However whilst we're enjoyed our last visit I was a little disappointed. 3 of us had ordered the same dish - geronimo's chicken surprise, which I'd tried and loved on my first visit. However when mine arrived the sour cream was missing and I had about half the salad amount of the other 2, with only salad leaves in it! There also was no chillies on the top of my chicken which the others had. Disappointing that 3 dishes going to the same table were so different.    Portions are absolutely huge here - fajitas were enough to share between two!",,
"2 lovely meals. The portions were very generous and very enjoyable. Get there early, or you must book. Queue had formed as we left. Drinks good price. Very enjoyable experience",,
"Excellent steaks, melt in the mouth. and deserts delicious. Friendly staff and entertainment and nice setting.",,
Very attentive service and good food. Did feel a bit pushed for speed and almost felt an inconvenience. Food was what you would expect but I can't say it was special. There is entertainment each night which is nice and the children enjoyed it.. All in all a pleasant evening but in the end average,,
"Cant fault things. This is the second time we have been the Fat Mamas. Portions haven't changed in 3 years and the prices seemed to have come down, so it is not only very good food, but also great value.",,
Lovely food and fabulous entertainment!! Eaten here quite a number of times and never been disappointed!! Lovely food very attentive staff and if your there around 9pm you will see the dancers doing a variety of shows each evening!!,,
"was staying kathinkos had a great meal here and the staff were the dancing show there was a magician on but he dissapeared bit expensive but well worth it,s facing breeze hire on the left next to fat willys well worth a trip big meals though",,
"looks good from the street as has entertainment & face painting for the kids,looks like they have the keep the kids happy & the parents will be happy approach.  Having ordered our meals & a bottle of wine & a bottle of water between two,we waited 1/2 hour before the meal came,still waiting for our drinks.My fajitas were frozen,I called the waiter & he brought me fresh wraps that were hotter but by this time the meal was frozen cold,we had called the waiter several times for our drinks,when they brought them it was 1 glass of wine & 1 glass of water,we complained & finally brought a bottle of wine we didn't bother about the water.However,they did try to charge us for two bottles of wine & two bottles of water.  DISASTER! Too busy catering for kids forgetting good paying adults!",,
"The staff were great and attentive. They gave us a free bottle of Champers as it was our honeymoon. The food is plentiful, tastey and omg filling. We love fat mammas!",,
It is many years since I visited Fat Mamas but glad to say the quality of the experience remains very good indeed. Entertainment was good fun with a Can Can routine being a highlight. The menu is extensive with steaks featuring highly done in many many ways. Service was good all the way through. Although you can not book a table other than for very early sittings they are well practised at moving people onto available tables promptly.  A great place for families.,,
four of us went out for dinner here and all had something different. All our meals were lovely. Great steak and friendly staff.,,
Large American size meals very busy but served in time. Great food and and service extensive menu average prices. Would recommend,,
Visited Fat mamas on our last night in Paphos ( gutted we didn’t find it sooner) Brilliant atmosphere food was to die for and the portion sizes were huge and excellent value for money,,
Our second visit to this restaurant and it is as good as it was five years ago the last time we visited Cyprus. The quality of the food is excellent and the value for money exceptional. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere relaxed and fun. The truly memorable part of this experience is for those who take on the challenge of cowboy sized ribs. The meat falls of the bone in tasty sauces but the amazingly huge portion at such a low price is a real fun challenge to try and complete. We all really loved this place.,,
"We booked after being recommended by people in are hotel ! Well how right were they !! The service , food and entertainment was superb .One of our part is Celiac which they asked on booking , they made her feel very relaxed.about her options . All are meals were extremely good .  Great food × great cocktails × great entertainment ..= fantastic night !!",,
"Visited a couple of times while I was on holiday and the steaks were amazing I've never tasted anything so good, great service and the entertainment was fabulous. Highly recommend",,
"Absolutely massive food portions, with Mexican or grill menu available. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food, service was good, staff very friendly & good value. Not sure about the ‘dance group’ & Fat Mama & her husband that make an appearance every night but its always packed & has a lovely atmosphere. Great for families - we would go again. Give it a try.",,
I had fillet steak (small) with chips and salad. All very nice if unexceptional. My sister had small ribs which were so huge they fell off the plate!,,
Amazing food and cocktails. We were looked after by all the friendly staff and enjoyed the amazing entertainment by the talented staff!,,
"Loved this restaurant! Great staff, awesome entertainment Nd the food was gorgeous! I’m veggie and the veggie pizzas were delicious! Highly recommend!!",,
"amazing place. Got the chicken in a blue cheese and broccoli sauce and it was absolutely unreal. Was going to get the “fat mamas portion” but decided to go for the small and there was more than enough I even had to take some home, so I can’t imagine what the big portions are like. Staff were nice and very chill which we like. atmosphere was good and the entertainment was a good touch!",,
Me and my husband went to fat mamas in June 2019. We were greeted by a polite English man with ginger facial hair. Our order was taken quickly and we received our cocktails. The cocktails were basic but nice enough. Our order came shortly after and the plate of food was a feast for the eyes. It looked and tasted amazing! It tasted fresh and extremely flavoursome. Can’t say enough positive things about the food.  During our meal there were 3 women who came out and danced every 3-5 songs. I do not feel they added anything to the overall experience at fat mamas. Their presence was quite baffling to the overall feel of the restaurants style and their dancing felt quite awkward throughout.  Nice restaurant and popular with British people. Prices for our meals was very reasonable.,,
Visited fat mama’s 8/9 years ago now and it was fantastic. This time around it was poor the menu has got bigger and I think in return the food has got poorer. Famous for their big portions and good hearty food no more I’m afraid.    Some staff were miserable and it took ages to get our bill when we just wanted to leave.    They don’t do compliments to the chef shout outs anymore either which was a nice touch. Unfortunately definitely no compliments to the chef or staff this time around.,,
"Went under recommendation and was not disappointed fab food,staff,drinks and entertainment,you cannot go to phafos and not come here.",,
"My partner and I absolutely loved our meal at Fat Mama's! The view was fantastic, staff couldn't have been more helpful! Would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of visiting!",,
"came here couple of times with my family while in paphos great food at great prices , even pleased a fussy 9yr old",,
"This is our 3rd visit here over the past couple of visits and it never fails to impress - HUGE portions , lovely staff and amazing prices - def worth visiting",,
"Amazing food that comes in huge portions, great fun vibe and the service was great too. Would deffo recommend!",,
"we were recommended this place by friends, we were very impressed with the quality of the food, but made the mistake of having Fat Mama helpings which were huge. The restaurant puts on entertainment nightly which is quite enjoyable and helps to give it a good atmosphere. Will return.",,
"Really nice food and entertainment excellent. A good fun evening out. Had the steak, very well cooked, the waitress was very professional and the dancers were very talented. They should be on tele.",,
This is a great restaurant fabulous menu and great staff The steaks are very good the menu offers a massive choice and I would highly recommend a visit if your in the Paphos area,,
"Recommended by friends went on a Friday night when it opened. Great service at the beginning by a lady and young girl then long waits for puddings, drinks and the bill we there over 2 hours no dedicated waiter for our table kept having to get their attention if we wanted anything else so not attentive or helpful. Food was good we had pizza medium as large portions. Entertainment from dancers especially if it was your birthday.",,
After reading all the reviews thought I would have a visit to Fat Mama’s. what can I say !Delicious great service great entertainment big portions good price. Hats off to you all will definitely visit again and recommend you to friends when they visit Cyprus,,
Great evening for dinner and entertainment. Found this treasure of a place on our last night. Entertainment brilliant from the staff and great wee half hour entertainment programme. This is a must for dinner and drinks. Oh and dinner was excellent.,,
"2nd visit here , nice place with entertainment, good food some huge portions, with very good attentive service from several waiters and waitresses",,
"Chose this place while looking for somewhere to eat on Tombs of the Kings Avenue. It looked appealing from the outside with the music and dancers doing their show. The staff were very friendly, the food and drinks were great and reasonably priced. I would definitely come here again if I return to Paphos",,
"Not top of the range, but reasonably priced and they try hard to entertain. The food is plentiful and the waitress was smiley - on the whole had a pleasant experience at FAT Mama's - something for all the family !",,
Food comes in large portions but is very tasty and good value for money. The staff are very friendly and the dancers are great entertainment.,,
"nice, clean and tasty, serivce is good, price are ok but a bit too much for the food. for the price this is ok...",,
"Fun, lively, family restaurant with entertainment all in one place. Italian and American style menus. Portion sizes are more than generous, good value for money. Easy parking immediately opposite on other side of the road.",,
"Love this place. 241 cocktails before 7pm. Bruschetta to start, hot and dangerous burger for my main, Godfather of chocolate cake for dessert. Huge portions, great food, great service at a great price!",,
Recently visited again with the the family and had a fantastic meal. Staff looked after us incredibly well. Food was piping hot and there was plenty to choose on the menu. Very good value.,,
Looking for our first dinner on holiday in Paphos & was recommended here by fellow guests . Arrived early to be greeted well & sat near entrance which is also where the dancers perform.  Waitress recommended ordering cocktails as 241 between 6-7pm great suggestion & ordered Black Russians as an aperitif- lovely!  We then perused the Menus for Willy’s & Fat Mamas as they are the same place really but offering traditional Mediterranean & also Tex Mex ! Huge choice but eventually chose the haloumi fajitas as I’m a pescatarian with my Wife Marion selecting fillets of Sea Bass!  Both dishes arrived shortly & were huge portions of very tasty food with ample veggies.  Managed to wade our way through the meal successfully but chose to forego dessert in favour of more drinks in time to watch the floor show which was brilliant - great value too at around £25 each including drinks  We will be back!,,
"Whilst in Cyprus on a family holiday, a family member who used to work at fat mama’s told us it’s a must do if your in Cyprus, particularly Paphos. He was not wrong. The children loved it. The food & drinks are very reasonably priced. The service is efficient & friendly. The food was delicious. I ordered steak & chicken fajita’s. I could not finish it & I have a large appetite. My wife ordered enchilada’s, our 9 year old son ordered ribs & little girl had scampi. Not one plate was empty, due to the large portions. We shared two deserts again due to large portions.  We had with the food  3 X cocktails  2 X kids soft drinks  2 X large beers (big bottle, bigger then pint)  The whole lot came to about €60!!!    One of the waitress’s even ordered us a taxi & we were told to wait at our table. The taxi driver will come and get you from your table I thought this was a master stroke so families can enjoy every second of the singing & dancing. Kids were also given coloring in stuff. Giving compliments to the chef is celebrated here, so you know what it means to the staff.  They also support local artists by giving them a chance to perform in front of guests. Fab all round",,
"Great hospitality ,fun entertainment , and even better food. Ordered the steak and wasn't disappointed we were celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary and we were announced by the dancers to rapturous applause and brought complementary fizz to make the evening more special",,
"Excellent food and atmosphere ,very quick to be seated the menu had a great choice ,soon arrived and nice and hot .There was even a small cabaret going on",,
People were queuing to get in very popular place Great menu choice Italian or Tex Mex Three lovely lassies dancing in different costume every ten minutes a must try,,
Food was really good and competitive pricing. Fajitas that wife had not the best we have had but good enough. They have their own dancers which was entertaining.,,
Excellent meal with cabaret dancing act. Meal was great and the staff were super friendly. Our waitress even went up and danced as part of the cabaret act later on.  We ordered the combo starter as a main and couldn’t finish it. Food was excellent.  We will be back.,,
"We ordered burger and large portion of ribs. All food portions are huge but we found the meat very dry. I ordered a cocktail which was really nice. The staff are welcoming, looking after guests very well. They have entertainment, which is different than other restaurants. But we went there mainly for food and were disappointed by the quality of it.",,
You have to use for a table even though the place is only half full the food is expensive with some portions huge to the point the staff tell you not to order it  And the so called entertainment out of step i think they are dancers but not sure  Walked away and are somewhere else do the same !!!!,,
Called for pizzas and was blown away proper stone backed went in a group had 4 pizzas and 1 burger everyone enjoyed top tip only order large if your very very hungry,,
"We visited as a family for dinner, we made a reservation as it is so busy. It was indeed very busy so we were sure we had made a good decision.    The waiters were great and guided us through two separate menus and explained that we could mix and match.    I ordered the crab on toast to start, which was basically finely chopped vegetables (cucumber, peppers, spring onions and tomatoes) minus the crab. I was gutted but decided to leave it and eat my sons potato skins with him and wait for my main. I had cannelloni which was at best 4/10.    There was disappointment all round at our table with the food.    Now for the entertainment, there are three girls which came out dancing in different outfits to various songs. The girls were great, they put a lot of effort into everything they did.    It’s a shame that the dancing girls attention to detail could not be transferred to the kitchen. The most disappointing thing is that the boss was the chef at the pass, letting all of this woeful food go out to the customers.",,
We went twice ...first time shared a starter then ordered the fajitas which was huge . We unfortunately didn’t have enough room for the delicious looking desserts.  Second visit I had a create my own pizza which was really yummy. Then we shared a huge slice of cheesecake  Service was very fast with a friendly team of waiting staff .  The evening Cabaret was different both nights we attended ... the girls are very talented dancers /entertainers and really get the crowd going. I will be back very soon to Fat Mamas,,
We had searched for well reviewed places to eat in Paphos and fat momma's seemed a good candidate because of it charming name and entertainment.  I went with a party of 4. The starters were lovely I had the chicken wings and my partner has the cheesy garlic bread. We asked if they did the greek meze but the waitress didn't know what that was and I was surprised as I thought it was common in Cyprus. For mains we all ordered burgers and I sadly didn't enjoy the burger patties because it smelled similar to wet dog and tasted the same (the daisy duke delight) the fries were delicious but the other members of the party enjoyed there meals.  The entertainment was great and a bit cheeky at times. Very talented dancers and built a great atmosphere.,,
"We have been here a few times and always enjoyed it, I was warned off by the staff about trying the cowboy rack of ribs I like a challenge so tried it........ failed half a rack left and did not touch my chips or sald Brill place. Fab dancers and good family place 4 meals and drinks €60 great value",,
"We only visited here once and the food was very good but portion sizes were too big. The Lasagne we ordered, one would have done a family of three. The prices are good too.",,
What a treat just as good as back home with pleasant surroundings and staff . Main road position with easy parking close by. The staff make everyone feel special from the little ones to the grandparents,,
We have never missed a visit to Fat Mammas each time we havebeen in Paphos. We love the friendly pleasant atmosphere as well as their pizzas.We always recommend it to other holiday makers .,,
Good greeting on arrival. Seating is mainly to open fronted restaurant. The food was well cooked and plentiful. Dancers during the evening with a cabaret show to finish.,,
"We found this restaurant thanks to trip advisor. What a find great food & entertainment, lovely staff with a special thanks to Maria.",,
"Had a great meal here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary. Read the reviews on TA and walked down from our hotel for a table. Great warm welcome from all the staff who were very attentive all evening, great atmosphere for couples or families, good activities for kids including face painting. Great food and cocktails at a good price.",,
"We have been here several times, good service, good food, best chilli con carne ! they have entertainment that’s ok, I think it’s more aimed at young families which is nice for the kids. The girls are good dancers and liven the atmosphere.",,
"Very nice evening! My son and my partner ordered ribs, one large one small they couldn't finish them as they were huge!! Well worth the price. Great food and service overall and high standard of house keeping maintained. Would go back when in paphos again.",,
What a great place. Good food. Fun. Dancing girls. They really look after you and good value. Quick service.,,
"We ate here quite a few nights , make sure you get seated before 8 pm to enjoy the entertainment . The food was lovely and if you are ordering the Ribs , I would only order a regular portion because the portions are huge ! you get two full size racks !  Very friendly attentive service, and you get a mini cabaret show thrown in with singing and dancing. It was my partners Birthday and they all sang her Happy Birthday and presented her with a cocktail and posed for pictures. The local wine in Cyprus is quite reasonable and very drinkable so we drank it most nights along with Cocktails!",,
"Staff were friendly. Food was really tasty and great sized portions. I couldn’t see the Cabaret, but that didn’t bother me as I personally didn’t see the need for it. However other diners seemed to enjoy it.",,
"Fantastic fun night loved the food, entertainment and atmosphere Portions are very big so maybe share dishes. Staff were very friendly with great service We really enjoyed our evening thank you",,
Stupidly only visited here on our last night. Wish we had gone sooner! Food was incredible and they have a show on at 8pm. Very entertaining. Would highly recommend.,,
Great restaurant for service entertainment and especially the food. Myself and partner had steaks cooked exactly as we asked and not a bit of fat on them. Would throughly recommend fat mamas.,,
"Well you have to go for the ribs, Defy anyone to clear their plate. There was enough food left, which they packed up for us, to take away and go towards our BBQ the next day.",,
Here you get the choice of 2 menus from fat mamas/Willy’s. an American style and Italian and you can mix and match the menus. The entertainment is good. Worth going here if your celebrating something such as a birthday or anniversary.,,
First meal out and not disappointed. Great service and great ribs. As a bonus you get entertained by dancing girls. Worth a visit.,,
"Went to Fat Mama’s on a recommendation and booked in advance as this restaurant does get busy!  Shown to our table and then greeted by a rather grumpy manageress who seemed slightly stressed as she asked us for drinks.  Once we were ready to order from a menu that is a cross between Frankie & Bennys and TGI’s the service was excellent and the food arrived even if there wasn’t enough room on the table for what was ordered, as the portions are big!  The entertainment during the evening was a plus but did get a bit samey after 6 or 7 dances but kept the atmosphere up.  Generally the food is good with sizeable portions and the service is attentive.",,
First visit to Fat Mammas and we were very pleasantly surprised to see a Vegas style show put on by 3 resident dancers while having our evening meal. The food was good and the service was very friendly. They also made people feel special if they were there to celebrate a special occasion.,,
"Have to say loved loved loved the food, drinks and staff was amazing so friendly I ordered the most amazing fajitas and my son ordered the chicken burger absolutely amazing only thing definitely 5star food and great prices the only thing was a little too much was the dancers they was good but a bit too much whilst trying to eat",,
"Very nice dual menu, kind personnel and nice intermittent fat mama's shows complimented dinner. Portions are really well sized and flavors are spot on.",,
Loved the food. Fiancée had vegi nachos. Loved them but the nachos were more biscuity than UK ones. I had chicken burger which is juicy strips in a bun. The chocolate cake is to die for. The dancers were great and we had a front row seat on table 3.,,
"First time dining at Fat Mamas... it was very, But much like TGI Fridays. The food was nice, lots of it & service was quick but that meant little time between starter & main & just 90 minutes before we had left the restaurant. Shows, well the dancers were ok, but we had been told it was more of a Cabaret so a little disappointing but that’s mainly because of what we thought we were going to see. All in all it was a nice evening, most staff pleasant & food was nice but not someone I’d rush back to.",,
We ate here twice and really liked it. The portions were huge! The menu is extensive with Italian and American dishes. If you eat before a certain time it was cheaper too bit decent value anyways. Service was really good.,,
"Stayed in an all inclusive hotel but fancied eating out so after reading reviews on trip advisor decided to go to Fat Mamas. As per info on tripadvisor we didn’t make a reservation And I think normally this would be ok but unbeknown to us they had entertainment on so we were very lucky to get a table! The waitress sat us down and gave us our menu next thing we knew there were dancers and a singer working their way round the room which was great! We ordered our food and when it came out we couldn’t believe it the portions were massive which was crazy because the price was so reasonable! We had more entertainment throughout the night with the lady referencing a special act later in the night (we hadn’t a clue) we asked the waitress and she told us it was Stavros Flatley from Britain’s got Talent we were buzzin. He came out all guns blazing doing his routine and then he got everyone up doing a bit of Greek dancing and had everyone doing the conga round the room the atmosphere was great and everyone was enjoying themselves. The bill came and as I said before for the portion size everything was reasonably priced . We had starter , 3 meals, desert, soft drinks and cocktails + the entertainment for 74.00 euro.",,
"After trying lots of authentic Cypriot food, decided to give this place a try for something different. American and italian menus which you can mix and match. Good tasty food and generous portions, pleasant staff and good atmosphere.",,
I went to Paphos for a 6 days with a mate and we said we would never eat at the same place twice. However the all changed when we visited Fat Mamas. Food was fantastic and great big portions. The staff were so friendly especially Odi the waiter. There’s a small show every evening and Stavros Flatley was even popping in but unfortunately that was the evening we were leaving. Everything else around was quiet on this street apart from Fat Mamas which had quite a buzz about it. If you got to Paphos you have to visit this place once and I’ll almost guarantee you’ll go back again. Keep up the good work guys and hope to see you again soon,,
"Not far off a 5 star review. Portion sizes were ridiculous, food quality was good to excellent, the only slight improvement they need to make was on the pepper sauce which was slightly powdery. Entertainment was great and focused on birthday parties with resident waitress singer and dancing troupe. Fun night out.",,
We were pleasantly surprised at the ease they managed to accommodate approximately 20 of us. The food was delivered quickly and was really good. Staff were very attentive. There was also entertainment on the evening we were there which was very nice.,,
"Huge portions, delicious food, very good service and prompt. Reasonable prices, will definetely go back!",,
To be honest not really my cup of tea . A bit like Mc Donald’s nice spare ribs but you can’t really go wrong with them,,
"They have lovely food and it is an amazing and fun experience. My family, friends and I all absolutely love Fat Mamas!",,
"Well located on the tomb of the Kings in Paphos, over processed dull unimaginative food, I ordered a Pasta dish it was one solid luke warm lump ugh!! under staffed , floor show ??!! So many lovey local restaurants serving decent homemade hot foods don't waste your time queuing here please!",,
"My wife and I 51, boy of 15 went in July. I know its been a while but I have been busy alrit! ;-]    Its a work thing where anyone going to the Paphos area has to try Big Mammas. We did and enjoyed it. Now I did think it would be a bit tacky. However the young ladies were sweet and the dancing and music worked while. We all enjoyed the food. I had to try the rips with my boy, very nice. The frozen cocktails also very nice. I was driving or I would have abused them.    Just an observation that it can be a little busy at peak time. So expect a little wait. I think we had a 10-15 minute. No big deal. I suspect this is a peak time for mum, dads and children    A special thank you to the older lady, hope that's ok to say. She may have been American. Very attentive, chatty and fun.",,
"We were looking online for somewhere to eat and this came up quite high so we decided to check it out    There was a cabaret show on as we entered and literally the whole restaurant was clapping along and so we were excited    The menu was almost too extensive and we had to ask the (patient) waiter a million questions so we could decide lol    When it came, it was big portions and oh so taste food. And there was a woman outside selling engraved glasses and the sound was kinda soothing - hard to explain    I was a little upset I didn't manage to go back as was good food",,
This is a great place to eat. The food is delicious and the entertainment is brilliant. I would definitely recommend it.,,
"Would recommend this restaurant, Delicious food with generous portions with entertainment through our meal.",,
When we arrived we were given two menus to choose from one was Italian the other was very American which was great as there was something that suited both me and my husband. The service was great even though the restaurant was very busy. We were looked after. We had the added free entertainment while we were there singing and dancing created a great atmosphere.  The food was plentiful and great value. Tasting amazing you won’t be disappointed.,,
"We had a lovely evening dinner here, the dancing girls were entertaining. Food was excellent very big portions though. Reasonable prices can get very busy.",,
We were recommended this place before visiting Cyprus and I'm so glad we were. We went to celebrate our friends birthday and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  We loved the surprise entertainment of singers & dancers including the dancers singing 'Happy Birthday' to our friend.  I had some of my Pizza left after the meal & the birthday girl had some ribs left and our waitress kindly wrapped them up & gave us the rest of them as takeaway portions. They also catered for our Gluten free friend.  Lovely food at reasonable prices.    All the staff were very friendly.    I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Cyprus :),,
"Great restaurant with friendly staff. Food is lovely, portion sizes are huge so I’d share if you don’t have a large appetite",,
"We visited on recommendations from friends before we visited Pahpos and so glad we did.  The food was amazing, although it did defeat us and we didn't manage a dessert. Between us we tried a large selection from both menus (American and Italian) and it was all delicious. Cocktails were also lovely.  The entertainment was great fun and really gave the place an atmosphere.",,
"Visited here with friends a few days after our wedding, amazing food, massive portions & very filling! Friendly staff & a great atmosphere. Will definitely visit here again when we return, you have to try the cheesecake!",,
Had been here 5 years ago and was well impressed. Visited twice this year and it's still good. Previously your waiters/waitresses were also the entertainment. They now have dedicated entertainment staff assisted by the waiters/waitresses. It's definitely an experience! The staff are lovely and the food is great. As usual in Cyprus the portions are large but tasty. Love the ribs! The photo is a small portion!,,
The food was still good and very filling. What was so evident is the staff want to get you in and out as quick as possible. Made us feel so uncomfortable here for the first time in years. Visited over 10 times over the years. Starters come approx 2-3 mins after ordering. Main meal come approx 2-3 mins after starters whisked away. Asked numerous times “have you finished?”  Compliments to the chef as usual.  Bring back the the friendly welcome please.,,
"Great food, great service, cheesy atmosphere: but fun! We had steak which was cooked perfectly a chicken dish and a child’s Bolognese. Perfectly priced too.",,
Luckily enough this restaurant was close to our apartment. Good wide choice of food and entertainment. If you like ribs you will enjoy this place. Also a wide range of other food. From burgers to pizza. Dancing girls entertain while you eat .,,
"We had an evening meal here, very large portions so go hungry to enjoy it. The staff put on an excellent caberet show during our meal. Staff were freindly and efficient.",,
"We went with a couple we wet the previous evening, they all had ribs, which they said were fantastic, I had a pizza which was pretty average. The entertainment was a bit of a giggle. The couple we were with had an anniversary so were both given a free glass of Prossecco which was a nice wee touch.",,
"Fantastic place!!! I would come back to Paphos just to eat here again. More than just a meal, it was a dining experience.    The quality and the portion sizes were out of this world. Although all the staff were very helpful and made us feel welcome, I must give extra praise for Ody who made my whole family enjoy the time we had. Just a shame we only found this place on our last night. Thank you mate and I hope to see you next year. Thumbs up to all",,
If in paphos you must visit fat mamas. Lovely food. Great entertainment and friendly and very helpful staff. Cant praise enough. Great night. Thank you all.,,
We ate as a party of 5 last week and were not disappointed. Everyone's meals were awesome fajitas to steak it was all delicious. The cocktails were also yummy!! We were plesently surprised by the dancers too especially when they sang happy birthday to my daughter :),,
Went here with my wife for dinner.  Service was excellent with very friendly waiting staff.We had regular pizzas and they were delicious. Great place if your celebrating a birthday etc. as the waitresses perform a birthday song with the obligatory silly hat. At regular intervals there is a dance/singing routine which is good fun.  Great place if your in Paphos.,,
"Visited fat mamas twice Food was amazing and portions huge, very good entertainment in the evening Drinks good and staff very friendly and helpful Would highly recommend",,
"Fat mamma's is a great place to go. Food is really nice Italian or USA menu. The entertainment was great as well, which were dancers 3 female and 1 male, although the male dancer seemed as if he didn't want to be there. Need to change him great value for money and staff were really friendly. Ordered the ribs nice taste and really large portion i must say. Looking around all plates were empty and no-one was in a hurry to leave.  Would have been a 5 star but didn't like the fact that you had to buy a bottle of the imported wine selection or drink a glass of the local stuff. Not impressed!",,
"Fabulous, we went quite late , but they welcomed us with open arms. Food was great, I had hunters chicken and hubby had steak. The staff at great. We have been before remembered it as great before so went back glad we did! Thanks Fat Mamas for a great last night for us xxxx. We’ll be back!",,
"We have eaten here twice so far on this trip and I can honestly say we have not been disappointed. On the first trip I had the chilli con carne which was very tasty with enough kick for you to know it was a chilli and not just mince. Very nice!. The second visit my wife decided to have the ribs which came in two sizes what the restaurant call small and then a larger portion. We asked the lady who sat you down (Maria I think her name was) which size was appropriate and she said the small was enough. She was not joking. The small portion consisted of three racks of ribs and the meat fell from the bone, served with a jacket potato my wife said it was delicious. I had the enchiladas which were also great. In addition they have a group of girls who dance at various points in the evening culminating in a short Caberet show which again breaks up the evening and provides something a little different. Overall very good value for money and well worth a visit.",,
"Just back from Paphos and tried this Restaurant Fat Mama's. It was amazing. Fantastic variety on menu, food was tasty and plenty of it and added bonus was show that they put on. Great night would defo recommend.",,
"I’m writing this as my friend and family are visiting Paphos in the very near future and because I’ve been here many times I came on the look at reviews as it’s been a few years since I’ve been over... I absolutely love the managers comments and quite rightly so bloody miserable negative people your food, service and dancers have always been amazing and I’m sure the standards are still as high as ever... excellent restaurant...great for family’s!! And birthdays!! I’m definitely recommending this fabulous place!!",,
"Had been here several times before but this time found main course bland and tasteless, starter was basic only the sweet seemed good. This was not a cheap meal either so expected better",,
"not the cheapest place to eat but the food is excellent & plenty of it,entertainment thrown in.staff all friendly and helpful.",,
"Led to our table by an efficient American lady who explained the menu to us, Italian or American ribs, served quickly with drinks and then our meals which were delicious. During the meal there was a cabaret with 3 girls strutting their stuff, helped by one of the male waiters, on passing the restaurant in the 2 weeks we were in Paphos the show seemed to change each night. Can recommend the place for families as the kids will be amazed, I know our grandaughters would have loved it!",,
"Had the Cowboy Ribs not for the faint hearted!! big portion really tasty, plenty of choice on the menue to suit all tastes.",,
"We went to Fat Mama's after seeing it on Trip Advisor, only word of warning is that it is not down on the harbour. On first look we thought it was but is a 25 minute walk from the harbour and is near the shopping mall. Well worth the walk though!    Menu has so much choice, we shared the meat platter between 4 of us to start. It was massive but so were our mains so I think everything is big at Fat Mama's. Mains were delicious and we could not manage a pudding.    Staff were lovely and really accommodating. We turned up with a very hungry toddler and asked straight away if he could have spaghetti bolognese which they sorted in minutes. They all chatted to him and made him feel included. We also asked if they had any yogurt and fruit and they made a special mix for him.    I would definitely recommend Fat Mama's ands we will visit again when we come back to Cyprus.",,
Absolutely brilliant food excellent we all so was entertained by singers and dancers a definite must to visit,,
"Awesome place. Had the hot spicy burger. Was really nice, huge burger, cooked just right. We've been before but we saw the cabaret this time. Not seen this in previous years - I think we've eaten slightly earlier in the evening before. Service was as good as our previous visits. Definitely worth a visit!",,
"we had a couple for yummy meals here, the service and food are great they certainly entertain you as well as feed you",,
Recently went to fat mamas with the girlfriend.  All the staff are very friendly an good vibe from the resturant. They also have entertainment going on.    All the food was very tasty and plentiful. Believe me if your hungry you be after  Had one portion of bruschetta for start it loads for two.  Main had spicy chicken and beef fajitas could of done with a little more kick.  Dessert was a chocolate fudge cake.  All the food we saw. Coming out looked and smelt nice.    We would definitely come back here,,
19 of us booked to go to this place we were skeptical but oh my goodness what a place to eat. The food portions were insane the entertainment is great there also. Staff all friendly. Thank you,,
"Recommend to cut it here and we weren't disappointed. Great place for ribs, steak or a burger, large portions can be a task.",,
"Wow what can I say, beautiful food but make sure your hungry....massive portions very reasonable prices. Went 4 times in our two week holiday.",,
"Absolutely amazing food , service and portion sizes , thanks for making it a birthday to remember for my daughter !!!!",,
"booked a last min table here for a large group and they were more then willing to accommodate us.    there are 2 menus a Italian and a american and you can pick and mix the food you want, really fast service, really nice waiters, food is really nice too.    the food has huge portions so bear that in mind when ordering.",,
We visited here with friends and found it to be good value for money. The food was good and alongside this was some entertainment which made for a really good evening.,,
"The food is ok, nothing too special but the prices are unreasonably high for what you get. There's a live 20min dance / show routine which can disrupt your meal",,
Lovely food recommended by myself and my husband would defo go bk lasagne was massive enough for 3 people very reasonably priced as well,,
"Been here 4 times over the past few years and it has been great each time. Great for families, friends and couples. Tonight I had the breakfast pizza which was delicious while the boyfriend had the pepper steak which was awesome! So much to choose on both menus - fat mamas and Willy’s. There are offers on drinks before a certain time in the evening and 10% discount if you eat before 7. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend.",,
"We arranged to meet some friends here for dinner after seeing them 2 years ago at their wedding. My Partner lived on the island and they were very special friends of his.  We had a great table right in the middle of the restaurant and it was very busy for a Saturday night and a popular place for locals but mainly tourists. We ordered nachos which were delicious and I ordered Steak Fajitas which were delicious. They have entertainment throughout the evening which was 3 girls who apparently appeared on Britain’s Got Talent! Watch it all the time didn’t recognise them and they just performed dance routines to different tracks but very underwhelming. They also have what I can only describe as an ode to Disney with two people dressed as Fat Mama and what looked like Woody from Toy Story very awkward to watch! Service not great no real enthusiasm and just trying to turn the tables around for the queue of people waiting to get in.  Food amazing, service not great and entertainment oh dear very poor! Would I go again probably not!",,
"this is in fact 2 restaurants joined, fat mummas and willys, one serving italian food and one serving american cuisine, the staff sing and dance and dress up as the characters from the restaurant, fun friendly and not quiet",,
"We have been in Cyprus 5 nights and been at Fat Mama’s every single m night the atmosphere is amazing, service is fantastic especially from layne and the rest of the service team, food is beautiful truly the best things we have tasted (coming from a very fussy eater.) Massive choice of over two menus and had something different every night and still want to try so much more, The dance shows and cabaret gives a huge sense of occasion every night. Will be back next time we stay in Paphos and truly looking forward to it. And even have bought one of the shirts for myself.    Fat Mama’s you are amazing thank you making our holiday the best    Steven and Millie  X",,
"I lived in Paphos for 5 years, but never ate here. Returning for a holiday, we decided to give it a go! Booked an early table as there was a young child dining and was seated straight away. It was reasonably busy, but not full. Service was ok, nothing special. Ordered drinks and food. Shared nachos to start which arrived quickly and were lovely. Next course a burger which I have to say was delicious! Rather underwhelming entertainment all night consisting of 3 girls appearing at regular intervals doing the same dance routine, just in different costume changes. Very boring, but apparently they were on BGT, so they must’ve been good right?! Wrong! They all looked slightly awkward and we were glad when they stopped! I’ll give the restaurant a thumbs up for food, but don’t come for the entertainment! Service ok, nothing special really. I didn’t miss much not visiting here before.",,
"Recommend the place! Really nice restaurant, with a night show every day. The food was delicious, I had the best burger here!",,
"Visited for our 5th time a few days ago, Fat Mama’s never fails to disappoint! Firstly, can I start by saying the lady who greets people at the enterance (sorry, I didn’t get her name, American lady I believe) is an asset to the team, gives a very warm welcome and is so friendly.    It was my first time of trying the ribs, WOW!! They are fantastic!! I got the large ribs (photo attached) it was two full racks of ribs, definitely would recommend this to share or get the “small” which isn’t so small for one person. My partner had the enchiladas which again are fantastic every time. He had the large, there is 4 of these in the large portion or 2 for the small!  I then had the godfather of chocolate cake, this is absolutely massive and accompanied by cream and ice cream but goes down very well after a lovely meal. My partner had the cheesecake which is his favourite pudding from the menu! Overall would definitely recommend!",,
"We were married in Paphos 15 years ago and all our guests went to Fat Mamas for an evening meal. It is true to say that the portions have decreased and sadly there is not as much pasta on the menu. However, the staff are a lovely bunch and the entertainment is good and it was good value. Well worth a look if you are in the area",,
"Enjoyed a wonderful evening here with my friends celebrating their wedding in Paphos. The meal was great and the portions are huge. The entertainment was ok although the dancers really didnt look like they were enjoying themselves at all.    Only criticism was that because our table was right by the kitchen, we were all feeling really uncomfortable during our meal, due to how hot it was. There was a big fan pointed at us but it didn't make much difference.    Apart from the heat, we had a great evening and would definitely recommend",,
Visited the restaurant in September. Nice food and the entertainment was good as well when the dancers came out ever 15 to 20 minuets. Would recommend a visit if your in Cyprus,,
"Me and a friend visited here and had gorgeous cocktails and they do the best cheesy garlic bread ever! No scrimping on the cheese! I also had a burger which was lovely, great place to stop off for a bite to eat and a few drinks.",,
"What can you say about this place, showbiz,large portions,loud music, and a good night out. Alex the owner and his team,really work hard to give you that buzz, that your night is special.,so make a point of saying to the staff that it is a special occasion,and then watch what happens, be ready with your mobiles to record the fun moments.........even if it is not your birthday, it's worth the ""Happy birthday whatever your name is"" Have used this venue for some years bearing in mind the owner is a ""Gooner"" so being a Spurs fan means a lot of banter!",,
"If your maxim is less is more, Fat Mama's isn't for you. Huge portions at reasonable prices with a floor show thrown in. If you're celebrating they go the extra yard.",,
"we ate here only once not because the food was bad just that their was so much of it, my hubby had a half rack of ribs which was more like a full rack and i had tortills , their was so much beef and veg on the sizzler plate it would have fed three. we had nachos to start to share expecting a single portion their was a nacho mountain. everything was delicious but so so much . if you go remember the portion size is massive .",,
Great service and good food Ody our head waiter was really friendly efficient and helpful Must visit in paphis6,,
"Excellent meal, we had pizzas and burgers. Tasty and value for money. Food cooked to order but was worth the wait. The show by the tgree dancers was fun and entertaining whilst we ate. Definately worth a visit.",,
"We visited Fat Mama's in late September, on a Friday evening. Me and my girlfriend both ate pizza, and I have to say it was delicious. Many toppings, good harmony of tastes, maybe the pasta could be a bit thinner. The service is excellent, they really take care about guests, and in every ~15 mins there were dancing girls for entertainment.",,
Great steaks and ribs to die for Entertainment mainly for the children 2 course wine and water about 60 euro,,
"Visited Far Mammas on the recommendation of a friend who had eaten there a couple of days before us and also 10 years ago when she last visited paphos, she assured us it’s as good now as it was then..... so glad we took her advice and tried it.  We were quite hungry so went straight for the mains, we both had the small ribs( one spicy and one regular) with a garlic bread to share(4 slices) absolutely delicious , the portions are really big, so much so my other half checked with the waitress that they were the small portions... they were.  It was very busy but they quickly found us a table as there were only two of us, we were served to food and drinks pretty fast and found it to be excellent value for money.  It’s very much worth a visit , highly recommend and would return. Thank you.",,
Large portions good food discount for cash takes sterling too Did not have starter or dessert but both looked good plenty of choice,,
"It's almost the end of our 2 week holiday in Cyprus and we've eaten out almost every night and had amazing food every night. we'd heard a lot of good things about Fat Mamas The amazing show and fabulous food etc and how you will be lucky to get seated without waiting. Well we got there and got seated straight away. I found the food to be mediocre at best. I didn't expect FROZEN CHIPS to be served with food of this price. Just because the portions are massive doesn't mean its good. The service time was very fast and the waiters are very attentive. 3 women did some singing and dancing every now and then.. I was waiting for the big show and realised that was it. No disrespect to the entertainment team of 3 but I can see dancing like that at any dancing school show. I don't know what we expected from Big Mamas but we both left feeling very disappointed and rather sick from attempting to eat the large portions. We've been spoilt by eating in some lovely restaurants in paphos. Sadly this was not one of them yet it was the most expensive. I did have to chase my change as mentioned by other reviewers, which was embarrassing. We won't be returning when we're next here. The menu is either American Italian or Tex Mex you can mix and match. This type of food I can get at home and it's nothing special.",,
"We were staying at an all-inclusive hotel and fancied a change of scenery.    We were recommended this restaurant and so glad we visited. The food was fantastic and the portions huge. I had pizza and my husband had steak - both were delicious. We really need a dessert, but they looked too good to turn down.    There is entertainment too, so it livens up the evening.",,
"Haven’t been to fat mamas for many years, the food and service as always was spot on!  The lasagnes was Home made and enough for two, chicken fajitas definitely sizzling and tasty!  Definitely recommend this restaurant, they also have cabaret act which is always very good",,
Our daughter picked this restaurant for her 21st as she has great memories over the years of spending an evening watching the dances and enjoying the food. Very helpful staff and fun evening,,
ate here a couple of times food was excellent waitresses friendly and helpful had fat mamas ribs which were huge and delicious would highly recommend this place,,
We had a great evening at Fat Mama's. The food was delicious and the portions were pretty big. The staff were super friendly and we felt really welcome. There was a small show on about every 15 mins with some singing and dancing for the length of one song at a time. It's a good place for people of all ages and the menu has a lot of variety. I would definitely recommend it!,,
"I really recommend a visit to Fat mama . We couldn't stop smiling . the service and live show was wonderful. the food tasty and satisfying. They are baby friendly and great hosts , they even sang a birthday song to my mom's birthday . Thanks for the good memories ,",,
Passed fat mama's while on holiday last week and on the off chance went in had a fabulous waitress named Layne took advantage of her recommendations of ribs and chicken the portions were amazing Layne was attentive and helpful gave us time to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and the show that came on later credit to restaurant.,,
Great fun restuarant that combines fiod and cabaret. the food choice is enormous and the portions are massive. Ribs were like something out of the flintstones. Staff couldn't do enough for you...fun night out,,
We came here twice during our weeks holiday we had lovely food the nachos are absolutely fabulous they have mince like chilli con carne on top of them it’s like eating tacos there well nice the steak was ok the chicken was ok the pasta was lovely the ribs fall apart the entertainment is very dated and a bit cringey with toy story and fat mama when there’s not 1 child in the restaurant it’s really silly they should defo get some new entertainment the girls come out to dance for about 20 seconds of a song then they go then again for a few seconds the entertainment is really bad but at least the food isn’t thanks for our lovely meals will defo be back for them special nachos,,
"Had a great time with family at fat mamas Food was great, beer was cold and the entertainment was fab.",,
"Been to Paphos half a dozen times over the years & Finally made it to Fat Mamas - we arrived around 8pm & only had to wait a couple of minutes to be seated. We were handed over menus right away & drinks order taken & arrived promptly. We had been warned that’s portions were generous so we opted for the nachos to share - good idea as they were more than enough for two. They were delicious & we couldn’t finish them as we wanted to leave room for our mains. I had the small portion of barbecue ribs & the other half had a pizza. Again excellent portions , the ribs were delicious & plentiful & himself stated the pizza was one of the best he ever had. We finished off with the chocolate cake to share - LUSH ! There is an excellent floor show with amazing dancers during the evening which added to our experience. My husband also commented on how clean the place was & how thorough the staff were on getting the tables ready for their next customers. All in all , a great night out , hope to see you next year .",,
"Suggested by friends and we had a great night out. The choice of food from 2 different style menus was very good. I opted for the steak, cooked perfectly to my liking, my wife had slim Jim salad with their home made coleslaw. Have the small portions as the sweets are not to be missed. Entertainment from the 3 very professional dancing girls with fantastic routines was exceptional.",,
Best meal we had anywhere in Paphos and great atmosphere. Get there early if you want to get a table without waiting.,,
"My partner and I ate here for our first meal in Paphos having been recommended by friends and family & reading all the reviews on here. We weren’t disappointed. We arrived just before 9pm. We had to wait approximately 5/10 minutes for a table. Plenty of staff working hard, serving customers, clearing tables, cleaning down tables & setting back up generally working well as a team.    We were shown to our table and asked if we’d been before, as we hadn’t we were shown how the two menus work (one Italian & one American which you can mix n match).    Not long after we ordered the cabaret show started which lasted for approximately 20 minutes.    The food arrived and the portions were massive and great value.    We also returned on our last night for our “final supper in Cyprus” - we ate just after 6pm. We didn’t have to wait for a table and once seated we were told it was happy hour on cocktails (by one get one half price - the only downside was you got both cocktails at the same time & my strawberry daiquiri was melting & giving me brain freeze & 10% off the bill if paying cash).    Again we weren’t disappointed with the quality or quantity of our food. A great last feed before our flight home.    Highly recommend adding this to your list of restaurants to visit whilst in Paphos.",,
We found out about this place through word of mouth. So glad we found this place. You can chose between 2 sets of menus : Fat Mama's or Willy's. You can even have small plates for various dishes. Very reasonably priced. Throughout the evening there were cabaret dancers and a Cabaret Show at the end. In all we were at the restaurant for 3 hours.,,
"That’s all I have to say “great ribs”. We come to Fat Mama’s every time that we are in Paphos. It’s not just the ribs, it’s the professionalism of the staff and the entertainment. Definitely a place to visit.",,
"Dined here today at 17.30 with my wife and 2 adult children. We were seated straight away by the most lovely lady with an American accent. This is the warmest restaurant we have visited during our stay, all of the staff were friendly and the service was faultless. The quality of the food and portion sizes were excellent, and the prices were very reasonable. The entertainment was good and is a really nice value added experience. We purchased some T- shirts and the waitress was really helpful in assisting us with size selection - when we returned to our apartment and tried the garments on they fitted perfectly. This is the fifth time we have been to Cyprus but the first time to Fat Mama’s, however we will be coming much more in future. Thank you for the welcome and for an all round great dining experience.",,
Enjoyed a plesant night and entertainment I would reconmend this to anyone. Lovley people. Some times it is hard to get in so rememer to book a table.,,
"Went here relatively early (still daylight) on a Sunday evening. Was a little surreal as every 10-15 minutes or so these three girls would do a wee dance number in the middle of the restaurant to a well-known tune. Became a little game between us to guess the song as we saw them walk out. It's cheesy but entertaining.    Food was decent but enormous. Managed to get to the point where literally neither of us could eat any more. In fact we went back to the hotel and to bed as we didn't even have room for another beer or cocktail. Never felt so full in my life. Reminded me of the Wafer-thin mint bit from Monty Python.    Top tip: Are you really, really, really sure you need a starter? (If you are going for it, my wife said whatever the cheesy, bacon mushroomy things she had was awesome, although combining that quite large starter with a pizza nearly finished her off!)",,
Well what can i say! The food was fantastic and even came with a short cabaret which we really enjoyed. Staff very friendly amd helpful. I have nothing bad to say about this place. I will be going again and i would definately recommend,,
"Show was ok to food not great which was a disappointment, we were let down by the pizzas, the shows are good but that really is as good as it get its quiet expensive for the food and service wasn't great.",,
"Cant fault this place , food amazing , staff brilliant . Well done to all the staff . Definitely recommend the rattlesteak 😄",,
"Fat Mama's is a tourist hotspot. If you like the gimmicky holiday camp style entertainment it's great. The food was lovely, massive portions, however it is very pricey for what it is and the music is so loud you cannot hold a conversation over dinner at all.",,
"My wife and I went for a meal at Fat Mama’s on the evening of Saturday 8th September, the food was good, service was excellent and the visit was topped off with a little entertainment in the form of a female dance trio, overall we had an enjoyable evening and I would be happy to recommend this venue to others.",,
"We always visit Fat Mamas when in Paphos. The food is average, very generous portions. Felt the cocktails were lacking in alcohol content this time and the Bailey's after dinner was tasteless. Free entertainment worth the visit.",,
"Food was nice, really nice but the atmosphere and staff were excellent. The young staff were friendly and very helpful. Highly recommended for a fun night out.",,
We visited in August and were lucky enough to catch Stavros which was an amazing performance.    On arrival at 7:15pm we were queuing on the path but were quickly seated much quicker than expected.    We shared a garlic bread starter followed by steaks all round cooked to perfection each one. Desserts and a live show stopping performance completed the evening.    Although they were busy service was efficient and attentive.    Highly recommend and will 100% visit again,,
"We had a lovely meal here - perfectly cooked, and with a nice side order of entertainment! Would thoroughly recommend this restaurant!",,
Kids love it here because of the show. The foods not bad either to be fair. Its packed every night. Good atmosphere and get 10% off if you pay cash :-),,
"Food was very good and not for those who don’t want a big portion, but it was also very well cooked and presented. The entertainment was great and made the evening a very enjoyable one",,
"Definitely put Fat Mama’s on your list of places to visit when in Paphos. 2 menus to choose from, Italian and American and you can eat from both. Food we had was great, portion sizes are big.  The cabaret show was good too, the girls at Fat Mama’s work hard throughout the evening.",,
Love this restaurant and have done for the many years we’ve travelled to Cyprus. It never disappoints. Even though we were all inclusive we still visited twice and it didn’t disappoint. Food was amazing. Service was amazing. And the dancers were amazing. Not a bad word to say about fat mamas.,,
Very busy restaurant and clear to see why. There was a queue but we did have to wait long for a table. Excellent for wheelchair access. Good menus to choose from. Prices are on par with everywhere else but you get a cabaret show too. The food was nice and the staff very good. We enjoyed our night out.,,
Great food and good value. Portions are generous. Staff helpful. Free entertainment in the form of a dance performance. Would highly recommend.,,
Love this place and have been coming here for 9 years. Entertainment is excellent and the food is decent. Visited this week with the family. Only complaint is our two favourite dishes are no longer on the menu. Spaghetti carbonara and the seafood spaghetti. Gutted Pacinos kiss has gone too. Bring them back please.,,
It's taken us 4 years to try this one but we were impressed . My husband had the rattlesnake steak and I had a mixed fajita. We will definitely go back,,
"Great food, even the smaller options were huge, great entertainment. Would highly recommend. Go early as usually busy and the queue can be long. Not able to pre book tables after 7pm.",,
"Had a lovely meal here with family... tasty food, big portions, and fab staff who multitask as the entertainment! 😀 Tea value for money!",,
"Just driving past every night made it pretty obvious this place knew what it was doing, queuing outside, so I called to make sure we got a table but when we got there it was still full so we grabbed a drink at the bar, I went for a Mojito, must say it was good, imported spirits I think.    We were sat near a lady doing face painting on all the kids and some mums, it looked like she was doing hair braiding too. I ordered the Steak alamamas i thin it was so tender in a garlic and brandy sauce. my friend ordered the king prawns with seasonal veg. As we waited we must have seen another 10 choices of what we could have had, the spare ribs marked for my next visit. Dinner was as good as it looked the drinks continued and then the cabaret started, what a brilliant show. i heard that Stavros Flatly still does a gig here occasionally, maybe next visit ? i was full up so we shared a chocolate fudge for dessert and it was delicious ... we are definitely going back !",,
"First off, this place hands down has been our best restaurant experience of the holiday so far. We were recommended by a friend with a focus on getting the ribs! So glad I got the ribs! Let's tackle a few things :    Atmosphere -    The restaurant has a very lively atmosphere with regular sudden renditions of dance and song down the middle of the tables. The girls dance, sign and sirande everyone who has a birthday. It's not over the top and actually livens the place up well. This is definitely a family / ""not boring"" couple place.    Food -    MASSIVE portions. Don't under-estimate the warnings about portion sizes and think about sharing most of the dishes. This makes the price point absolutely phenomenal. You can seriously stuff your face with delicious food and come back with change from 20 euros.    Drinks -    Decent selection of drinks and in-line with most of the other restaurants. No really fancy cocktails but decent enough to beat a lot of the rubbish pubs on the strip.    Altogether, I'll be back and really enjoyed my time here. Thanks for the great night.",,
"Lovely welcoming staff, huge portions so great value for money! We even got some entertainment while there!",,
"Great food, great entertainment, large portions. Such good value for money. Don't order too much like we did. Great location right on main road on the way to harbour",,
"Walked past mamas 3 times & every time there was a que , & always very busy . so we had to join the que to see what was going on , service was spot on , staff & atmosphere very good , food was served at a reasonable time & pace , considering the amount of diners there , food was delicious & very hot when presented to us , & if you cannot finish it all you can have it boxed to take it away",,
Great place to eat food was great our friends took us there 14 years ago when we first went to Cyprus and we have eaten there a few times since when we are out with friends,,
"Great food great service great atmosphere! Good value for money. love the entertainment going on whilst eating and drinking. the food portions are very big, don’t think I’ve finished a meal there yet. would recommend it to everyone! one the highlights of my holiday.",,
"Visited this place twice on our two week holiday, the food is delicious and the entertainment is good. Staff were friendly and although it was always busy and people queuing to get in we never felt rushed to hurry up, even when we paid the bill. The portions are a good size. The ribs are delicious but don't order the large portion unless your up for a challenge (man v food) the normal portion is more than enough. If you go to Paphos you have to go here.",,
"We love Fat Muma's, I first visited 7 yrs ago with friends and have made sure it was a dinner date every visit since. I have introduced my Husband and step daughters to the wonders of Muma's now too. It is always a family favourite with all my family. The steak and Ribs are amazing and the portions are huge even without going cowboy size!  The shows are good for keeping the kids entertained whilst eating.  If you go between 5pm-7pm you can book a table anytime after 7p. It is first come first served and its that good there are always people waiting to be seated, its worth the wait!    Ps the picture is a kids ribs amd chips with Garlic Bread starter... :0)",,
Lovely restaurant always busy. The steak I had was amazing!! Perfectly cooked & so soft. Lovely staff & great little dance routines they performed. Great place for the family.,,
What can I say that has not been said before.  Well from our fsmilies opinion the food and the quantity and quality of it was fantastic.  We got an unexpected bonus of seeing Stavros Flatly when we dine here. They have great entertainment on every night.,,
Very nice place to visit Great atmosphere Live shows American & Italian menus A place to spend 2 hours & to eat a lots...,,
"Really disappointed with this Fat Mammas restaurant. Starters served quickly and vey nice. Then it was down hill.........    My group of 11 were sat next to the waiting area. So as we were sat eating our main course that took nearly 1 hour to be served, people waiting to be seated were nudging our chairs getting past, there were to many people in the waiting area, Fat Mammas were more interested in getting those waiting to buy a drink than ensuring our meal and service was good enough.    I informed a member of staff about the people waiting behind us and the lady was just not interested., more interested in getting us to buy another drink!!!    Never again.",,
"Had a good few nights here, food good, entertainment good portion sizes very good would recomend.Would go back again.",,
Pavlos was wonderful - hospitality great all around. Food was brilliant - be prepared for large portions. Book in for 7pm - no other times available. If you arrive late you can queue but have to wait awhile. Be prepared for the singing and dancing which have bee requested by customers who are celebrating an event. You must visit Far Mamas before you leave - meal for 2 no dessert around €66 - arrive b4 7pm you get 2 same drinks for price of one.,,
I visited Fat Mama's twice with my family and always had nice friendly service and excellent food both in terms of taste and quantity. There is nice entertainment and shows for the kids.,,
"This was the second time we are at Fat Mamas. We booked a table, but people didn't queue for long for a table.    The food was brilliant as usual and the half portion of ribs defeated my son! I had Mediterranean Chicken with jacket potato, absolutely gorgeous. Very generous portion.    The entertainment was very good too. The three girls doing very quick costume changes to do their brilliant dance routines.",,
"My family and I went 3 times, the meals, the entertainment, all were great, and if you have a special occasion you are in for a treat, I cannot recommend highly enough, thank you fat mamas.",,
"We were in Paphos for 14 days and ate out every night, this was by far the worst place we visited. Portions are huge but the quality of the food is terrible. The Spagetti Bolognaise was so dry and tasteless with literally no sauce. The ribs were also tasteless with very little meat despite looking like a huge portion, even the house bbq sauce couldn't compensate for the lack of taste. There are way better places to eat in this area and in Paphos in general. Would give 0 stars if I could.",,
"Serves a good menu of pub food with a nice drink menu. We got there before 7 and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. After dinner, the line was extremely long. The key is the entertainment which is three British ladies dancing to popular tunes. Nice.",,
"Came to Fat Mammas on the recommendation of friends who had been before, did not disappoint our party of 11. Excellent food, massive portions and the entertainment throughout the night kept everyone in the party mood especially when Stavos Flatley made a guest appearance - we will definitely be back",,
Great food great atmosphere cabaret were only on for one song we arrived 9pm so maybe they stop then which us a shame and they were quite hard to see    Drinks took 25 minutes had to ask three times and in end starters can’t out first .    Food good portions massive nice treat just loose a star for drinks taking so so long,,
"we went in here for a steak and chicken fajitas, they was lovely, well worth the money, nice and clean, the staff are very friendly and helpful.It does get very busy so either book your table or go in about 7pm, we didnt have to wait too long.",,
"Very busy restaurant on the kings road, worth booking before hand.    The restaurant is very entertaining with its costumed dressed staff appearing every 30 minutes or so to do greetings and dance routines.    The food is ok and prices very reasonable, if you have young children they will love it.",,
"Been here 4/5 times over 2 visits to Cyprus. Always got entertainment on and always friendly staff. Place is always busy and there are always queues to get in. Decided to have ribs which were great with lovely thin fries. Proper American style ribs which Paphos lacked. I have tried pizzas here before too which are also pretty good. Place is a must visit for its entertainment,location and tasty food. Would come back again+",,
"We visited here one night of our holiday. Had to queue to get a table and service was slow due to being so busy. Food was good, portions are massive!! Dancing round the restaurant every 15 mins was a bit naff but different I suppose.",,
"Loved this place , came for a birthday meal with my mum and my hubby ... atmosphere was fantastic, food was amazing, the girls dancing were fab , I even got to wear a special hat as it was my birthday and was given a cocktail too would definitely go again",,
"The food was delicious - especially the burgers! The cocktails were also yummy followed by amazing chocolate cake. The best part of this restaurant was the entertainment which was great fun to watch, spontaneous and created a great atmosphere to be in. This is definitely the best place to eat in the area, there was always a long line of people waiting for a table. We would highly recommend thank you Fat Mama!",,
"There is a sign in the restaurant saying if you want a quiet night, this is not the place for you. And that is true but the flash dance shows are brilliant and the food is excellent as well. The staff are friendly and willing to amend dished for you. There may be a queue outside but worth the wait.Located on Tomb of the Kings Road 10 minutes from the shopping Mall",,
So we had such a great night    Food was really good I had Steak some had ribs etc be careful the portions are massive so sharing is caring !    Then they have entertainment really nice dancing singing kids loved it too    Very attentive well looked after and very reasonable    A must in paphos,,
My family and I recently ate here we had to queue for a while but when seated after about 15 minute wait the service was excellent. The entertainment can keep younger diners happy whilst the older members of the family eat and the food was good. Overall an nice friendly night out .,,
"The food was pretty good, just a bit English for me personally, cabaret with girls coming out, singing and dancing to Michael Jackson, Spice Girls etc. which isn't really my thing as I prefer more of a traditional feel. The staff here are lovely and if you want a table get there early as the queue starts building up!!",,
"Huge portions, delicious food, very polite and kind staff. Reasonable prices. Every evening shows. Highly recommended!",,
Both Italian and American food with entrainment by the way of 3 dancers coming out every so often dancing and singing happy birthday to people nice atmosphere nacho starter would feed four people big portions,,
"Have been here a few times. The food is plentiful and tasty and the entertainment is great and adds to the enjoyment of the evening. Great place, always good. Keep it up. One of the best in the area",,
"We visited her twice during our stay and found it both times to be good value for money. They had offers on at certain times, discount for paying cash, entertainment during your meal and the portion sizes even for small size requests were huge! I would certainly be a fat mama if I was a regular visitor there. Would recommend to all and the queues nightly speak for themselves.",,
"We went a couple of times as we have been before. Food excellent but too much is served, can give you a doggy bag though. Entertainment was great and weren't in your face. Great value for money and even bought a souvenir t shirt.",,
Absolutely fantastic food and brilliant service would highly recommended coming here for food. Entertainment was great too and made a fuss of our daughters birthday. Will definitely visit again.,,
We visited fat mammas twice during oir recent 10 night holiday. Great place with fantastic food. Staff were great and friendly and entertainment was brilliant. Only slight complaint is the tables aren't huge so not much room on a table for 4but like i say.. just being picky,,
"Great entertainment and good food, although as a large group we were seated to the rear of the restaurant (would of prefered front as it was very warm needed to use large fans to keep temperature cool), that said food was loved by all - portions are large and service is good - wine was good too!",,
"Ate here 3 times during our recent stay in Paphos, food was excellent on each occasion. Restaurant is always very busy, but you never have to wait long for a tablet and the staff are very attentive even though they are busy.",,
"We had been recommended so many times to eat here by different friends, so on our last night in paphos we ditched our all inclusive hotel food and came to fat mamas/ Willy's..  the service was great and friendly, we had arrived just in time for a dance show by 3 ladies, which made it hard for me to concentrate on picking what I wanted to eat! There's so much to choose from for food which also made it hard for me to choose as I was given 2 menus with completely different food on! I ended up going for fajitas and it was amazing! My partner went for pizza and normally can eat everything however this filled him up and he loved it! Would definitely return here",,
"Staff that attended to us were lovely, very pleasant, food portions are big, ribs were lovely and just fell off the bone, my sister said the steak was the best she had ever eaten, there was a little queue when we arrived, had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, food was nice but I don’t think I would queue up to go in again, but worth a visit if in the area.",,
"This restaurant is not what I would choose being we mainly eat out as a couple but for a family I would say it's perfect, good quality and quantity of food and they provide entertainment. It's very popular so I would recommend that you reserve a table especially peak season so you don't have to que on the street. Enjoy!",,
"The outlet was recommended to me prior to the holiday    I would now do the recommending    If you are anywhere near give it a go, you may have to suffer a short wait for a table, but well worth it, very slightly more expensive than other nearby outlets but portion size is great. If anything portion size is too big    Well worth it",,
"Very busy spot but great service and nice menu. Lots going on, with singers and fat mama herself paying a visit. If you have a special date, it would be good to go here as they will help you celebrate with a song. Good size portions and very reasonable with it. It’s not traditional Greek, but Italian tex-mex style so good for kids. Will be back again in the future.",,
"Always busy but worth the wait if your preference is large portions, dancers between courses and singing happy birthday to people. A ""feel happy"" kind of place with great service anf fun",,
"Been going to the island for the last 10 years and have been to Fat Mamas every time. We were advised it was that good and we weren't disappointed. Great food, plenty of choice and some great entertainment while dining.  Going back to the island at the end of the month and have already emailed our reservation.",,
"Cocktails were pretty average, service was ‘complicated’ and menu wasn’t ‘flexible’ compared with most other places I frequent in Paphos. Food was ok, portions were big and cabaret show was entertaining. Dancers were good and vocalist excellent. My nieces 7 & 9 loved it though so I’m not complaining... wouldn’t recommend to couples but as a family venture serves its purpose well!    Perhaps worth mentioning the 10% cash discounts and the cocktails offer is only applicable if you pay cash. Slightly unusual.",,
"My boyfriend and I came here for a meal last night and we both loved it!    The food was amazing, the best meal I’ve had out it a while. The meal was proper home cooked, fresh food. We shared mussels and cheesy garlic bread to start. Then we both had steaks, everything was cooked to perfection and the steaks were cooked exactly how we wanted them. The portions are huge! There is so much choice on the menu. We also got 10% off our bill as we ate early.    The staff were all lovely, and really friendly. They couldn’t do enough for us.    Will definitely be back if we’re ever in Paphos again.",,
"We had burgers, I had a very spicy one which was delicious Kids meals are a good size portion Dancing and music for entertainment",,
"We went for dinner twice during a 7 day holiday in Paphos. The food was good, portions enormous and a good selection for vegetarians. Prices very reasonable. The kids really enjoyed it, the main reason we went back. Actually they asked to go again for a third evening :)    The staff are brilliant, really friendly and attentive. They made a big fuss of the kids which went down very well. The Fat Mama's dancers were surprisingly excellent with a variety of costumes, dances every so often. At around 9:20pm they did the cabaret show which was different on both occasions. We thoroughly enjoyed it.    Food highlights: The halloumi fajitas (ask for jalapenos on the side) and the Godfather chocolate cake.    We had to queue for a short while but it was worth it.",,
Meal was delicious. Portions enormous. Especially childrens. Staff very attentive. Entertainment amusing but cheesy. Definitely a family restaurant.,,
"Had a nice meal here after a bit of a queue as we thought it must be for a reason. It was very nice but I wouldn’t say it outshone anywhere else. Well priced.    I think maybe people rushed for the early diners discount.    Random singing girls throughout our visit, occasionally announcing birthdays and anniversaries.    On a par with the rest, worth a visit.",,
"Packed every night and well worth the wait (10mins) to get seated, we have eaten here during previous visits and have never been disappointed.",,
Visited this restaurant twice during our stay. Great choice of food on the menu. Friendly staff. Very loud music tho. An enjoyable experience. Would recommend the ribs !. Recommended.,,
"Wow, there were 12 of us that visited Mamas and it was amazing. Our table was booked for 7pm as this is the last time you can book, after this it’s just walk ups and you wait.  Amazing food and staff. you weren’t rushed to leave, the shows were amazing and everyone enjoyed themselves!  If visiting Cyprus you need to go to this place highly recommend, it was our second visit. Thank you Fat Mammas x",,
Went to Cyprus last year and was suggested by so many people to go here for a meal. We did and absolutely loved it that we went again while in Cyprus.  The food was amazing - great variety and good mixture between Italian and American. Plus the entertainment was great and made it such a great night. Would definitely go back here if we was to go back to Cyprus.,,
"We have been to Paphos for 3 years running and only found this place on our last visit. Gutted we didn't find it before.  They offer a very varied menu to suit adults and kids alike and the portion sizes are huge! The food is delicious. Highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread, the burgers and the ribs! The service is first class too and great value for money. We'll be heading here first on our next visit!",,
"We have just returned from a 19 night all inclusive. We were celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary so decided to eat out. Along with friend and their children Fat Mamas made our night, a warm welcoming restaurant with lovely friendly staff, the food was amazing and very large portions. Highly recommended.",,
"Only enjoyed drinks and the entertainment here as we were staying half board at the Elysium, but the flow of happy customers and the look of the food would make it a must..i have never seen burgers so large",,
"We enjoyed our meal! Food is great, staff is amazing! It’s a really clean place, and we enjoyed that they whipped our table regularly. :-)",,
"Tried here as seemingly a good choice on menu, all appears frozen, not particularly great service, pizza was a bit tasteless, but salad and burgers were reported as being tasty, we didn’t return as found better places nearby, entertainment ok, girls very pretty anyway",,
"We ate here on the recommendation of my daughter and what a meal! Best burger I’ve eaten in a longtime. My son had the Chicken Fajitas which was a huge portion and really tasty . My daughter had the Al Capone Pizza which was really nice. Add the entertainment and great service and a top night was had.  Well worth a visit, we’ll definitely eat here again",,
Very busy with entertainment through the evening. Good food and reasonable value. Huge portions. Evening made by our attentive waitress Lane.,,
Visited Fat Mama's twice while on holiday and had really good food and good service. The portions are huge so go when you're hungry. The entertainment is good and they go out of there way to make sure you have an enjoyable time. Great place for a special occasion as they make a special effort if it's a birthday/anniversary etc.,,
Came here on the last night at paphos. Was worried as we heard so many good reviews and how busy it gets that there would be a big Que considering it was a Friday night too. We arrived st about 7 and there was only one group of people in the que and we got seated almost instantly. The food was amazing and the entertainment topped it off. The cocktails are also really good (recommend the dirty waiter cocktail). Considering it is a busy restaurant with entertainment coming on we were served quickly and wasn’t waiting around too long for anything. Would recommend to come here if nearby or visiting on holiday.,,
"Good place to go in the evenings, can get busy. Food is good and reasonably priced, service is ok too. The difference is the entertainment on nightly, makes it more than just a restaurant.",,
Went to Fat Mammas in a family group of six catering for 3 different generation and everyone's meals was perfect... I have been to Paphos many timess over the years and never ate here before. I found the service exceptionally fast and the staff very ploite and helpful. I hade lasagne and it was beautiful...the size was very generous and it came with chips. My son had a rack of spicy ribs which look huge...he said they too were beautiful..all the others too thoroughly enjoyed their meals..will visit again if we come back to Cyprus..,,
Some of the best food I have ever had! Great big portion sizes (maybe a little too much) but all cooked fresh and all served hot. Staff are very good too,,
Huge portions. Lots of wastage. Who needs huge bowl of pasta served with a jacket potato?...good basic food although happy hour drinks offer is confusing 2 for 1 cocktails between 6 and 7 means you can't order 2 different ones and get one free but you get 2 of whatever you order. Cannot mix cocktails and mocktails. If you come here more than once you will notice entertainment is the same 3 girls doing same songs every night.,,
"I’m currently on my final days of holiday and thought it was a good idea to come to fat mamas, I had very high expectations for this restaurant and it definitely fulfilled them expectations. I could not believe how welcoming the staff waiters and waitresses are also they all speak different languages which is perfect. But it offers two separate menus, an Italian and an American. But the food is outstanding and words can’t describe how tasty it was. I hope this review helps.",,
"We went to Fat Mama's by chance, saw some people queuing up,and thought this could be good. Not disappointed, an American style diner with a great menu, we had fabulous starters, wings and nachos, followed by sizzling fajitas a couple of authentic chicken dishes and a fish course, my only gripe would be, and not a bad gripe, the portions are huge and we sent back quite a bit of food, which I sometimes feel is a slight on the food, but definitely not here. Reasonable price and some great entertainment whilst you eat, 3 lovely girls dancing to various themes all night. A good night out..",,
We had a lovely evening meal with fun entertainment will definitely return. We were staying in a hotel 5 minutes from there here. Get there early as there are queues outside.,,
"My wife and I went to Fat Mamas during our stay In Paphos. It became one of our favourite places to eat. Friendly staff, terrific food, good prices , great atmosphere and dancing girls for entertainment too. What more could you ask for? A must visit during your time in Paphos.",,
"Our first visit at Fat mama's and we enjoyed it. The service is good and they are very polite and professional.  The atmosphere is great, the cabaret show was excellent and fun. It was very entertaining and we sure didn't expect it but we enjoyed it a lot.  The food is good, a little bit overpriced. The burger was ok, the small rib portion was very good, it's big and tasty.  We enjoyed our night and as it says on the card, it's a place for a perfect not quiet date :)  If you go to Paphos you should definitely visit it.",,
"So we had an evening meal here the night before my brother got married. We were surprised to get a table for 9 so easily! Every time we passed previously there had been a huge line waiting for a table, but that evening we were extremely lucky and managed to get a table after only a couple of minutes.  We were served quickly by a courteous and efficient waitress. You are give two menus to choose from: the Italian menu (fat mamas) and the American menu (Willy’s) The food was excellent albeit the portion sizes were not for the faint of heart as they were HUGE off of the American style menu. Everyone finished their meals despite this though.  There were mini “shows” put on through the night for various tables celebrating something and they were entertaining. We refrained from organising one for our brother as we were all more interested in food!  Overall the evening was very enjoyable and if we weren’t going home we’d go again, just wish they had beer mats for the drinks. Definitely on our places to eat if we come back to Cyprus!",,
"I have been to fat mama's multiple time and every time I come to Paphos I have to visit fat mama's, not just for the lovely entertainer girls :). Firstly the portions are huge and if you go for the even larger portions then good luck. First night I chose from the American menu and got the hot BBQ ribs and decided to get the extra large portion which is two full racks of ribs, one rack was massive and to my amazement you get 2 full racks, They were absolutely delicious, The meat just fell off the bones and the sauce was lovely and covered every inch plus the hot sauce I had on top, which also was delicious so asked for more sauce.    The next visit I chose from the Italian menu and got the mussels to start and then the fat mamas pizza and as always went large and once again they never disappointed me, flavours and meats were amazing, the pizza base and crusts were very light and fluffy and cooked to perfection. My wife got a burger and had it medium rare and I tried it and I would go as far to say it was one of my favourite burgers, not just because of the topping but the quality of beef and how perfect and juicy it was cooked.    Everyone on my table was satisfied and left completely full up and had to take some home in a doggy bag, tasted just was good 2 hours later.    Fat mamas also has 3 lovely entertainers which kept the night fun and lively, i'm sure the girls caused a few arguments between couples XD but they are there to entertain so keep staring.    Overall a great chilled vibe and if you want quiet then don't go. Food was amazing as usual, prices not to bad but they get you on the drinks.",,
"First time to Fat mamas loved it so much we went back for our final night. No it’s not traditional Cypriot but we done a lot of those, but it’s amazing food averagely priced and huge portions. Entertainment thrown in by 3 young ladies dancing and singing , my daughter was captivated it was a good evening can’t complain at all.  We will def revisit on our next stay in Paphos !!!",,
"Great service, food and welcome. We are sitting here now having eaten for the first time at the restaurant and are already planning another visit in two days. Prices are good and food better",,
"Our family LOVE going to fat mama’s. I have always had the same meal when going here as I enjoy it so much and am therefore scared to try anything else! We had the meat feast sharing platter starter and I had the chicken, pasta and broccoli in cheese sauce. I had the smaller size as even that is HUGE! My husband had the enchiladas. The atmosphere is always amazing here, as well as the food. I don’t think we’ll ever go to Cyprus without visiting fat mamas!",,
Best place in Cyprus Delicious food Amazing staff who are very friendly! The live show was great! Kept us entertained!!,,
"We had a lovely meal here 2 years ago and were really excited to return. Unfortunately it didn’t live up to our first visit. The starter was lovely, my husband enjoyed his burger but I had pizza for main and it was tasteless and covered in black pepper. Hugely disappointed after our first visit being so memorable.",,
Went here mid july thought it looked good always busy music going.  Was sat a table told about menu as there are two different styles of food one of us got pizza which was cooked well and was enjoyed the other was cannaloni which had no flavour at all if we had not had side of chip would have gone away hungry. Music started and dancers came on it is so gimmicky and corny.  What was worse was the waitress kept wiping the table even when we were eating as soon ad one of us finished the plate was whisked away without the other person finishing there's.  IT IS ALL SO RUSHED!!  NOT FELT WELCOMED ONCE YOUR SEATED AND ORDERED.  PERHAPS INVEST IN MATS FOR DRINKS  SO GUEST DONT GET BOTHERED BY THE TABLE BEING WIPED DOWN A THE TIME.  Would not recommend and haven't for the rest of our holiday.  There are better places at decent prices on the avenue.,,
"Even the small portions were absolutely massive, decent quality, brilliant entertainment, kids loved it as did we. Again even the kids meals are giant, if you go for lunch you'll be still full at dinner. An absolutely fantastic place.",,
What a fantastic evening. My brother and sister in law were over on honeymoon and well told the restaurant. 3 entertainment ladies came over and sang then announced that they were on honeymoon and gave them a small bottle of prosecco. Food was fantastic with big portion sizes. Staff were great and looked after us very well. Definitely go back again.,,
"What a great place to eat, chill & be entertained whilst eating your meal. Was met by a very happy front of house staff member who showed me to my table & explained the two menus (Fat Mamas serving Italian food & Willys serving American food) you can mix & match from both when ordering your meal. I had a starters and a main meal but after eating both wish I only had the main meal due to the generous portion sizes. I had the cheese & bacon potato skins with two dips which were very nice. I then had a large portion of ribs which came with chips. Ribs were very very large,great bbq taste,with the meat falling off the bone - they were LOVELY !!  The entertainment was really good too, with singing & dancing plus if you were celebrating your birthday they came over to your table to sing & wish you a happy birthday.    All staff are friendly, establishment is kept clean including your table during the meal & the food is very well priced.  I recommend this place, if I was on holiday again I would definitely go back !!",,
"This place has spontaneous dance routines going on which was a surprise and is fun. There is a show each night which is worth a watch an all. The food is delicious, the portions are huge! The staff are friendly.",,
"After recommendations from our hotel & guests, Fat Mamas was a must visit.  I was sadly disappointed well by the service & staff.  Waitress wasn’t pleasant, took our order & told us it would be a 30 minute wait as my friend had ordered steak (this wasn’t a problem, happy enough to sip on our drinks). Our order arrived within this time, but one problem they got my order wrong. Sent it back & they sorted it. I ordered the burger which was gorgeous once it was corrected, and the steak was cooked to perfection.  We had dessert which was very nice also. They offer a cabaret show while you eat which was very good, although the young lad taking part no more looked happy to be there, the girls were fantastic.  Food was very good, just a shame some of the staff let it down.",,
"Me and mum came here to have the 2 for 1 cocktails between 6 and 7 their happy hour. Which were lovely and full or flavour. We then decided to have their nachos and these were scrummy.    We then decided to come back on our last night before we went back home. We were shown to a table by a mature lady with glasses. We then noticed little black bugs all over the table, plates and cutlery. We asked to move and we had a reply of ""oh it's only nature come on then you can sit over here"".    Feeling awkward I replied I don't want to be eating bugs and she replied ""you're in an outside Cyprus restaurant, this won't be the first time your covered in bugs here my ladies'    Overall lovely food but very rude of the woman to comment the above. And moving us reluctantly like we were a pain.    Would of been 5 but with the lady being the way she was she knocked it down.",,
"Best burger i have ever eaten. I would totally recomend this to anyone and i would personally come here every evening if i had the chance. If you come to Paphos, you have to come here!!!",,
"Excellent place to eat, lovely staff. Extremely quick service. Ribs were excellent..in fact the starter was so big for two we couldn't eat the main course of ribs so we took it away . Entertainment for all provided. The dancers were good and any family with little girls will love it as the few girls we observed were loving it. Highly recommend this restaurant .",,
"What a lovely meal and great atmosphere.    We arrived and were welcomed to a table and the menu explained. There is the Italian Menu or America Menu and you can mix and match.    We all shared 3 starters and then had different mains and we were all catered for. I had the mini ribs, which was 12 in total and more than enough!    No room for dessert but a great value for money and good evening.",,
"We had an amazing meal could not ask for anything better. The food was very good especially those spare ribs. Great service, great place, our waitress Maria was really fab and looked after us well!!",,
"This is a great nights entertainment & food is excellent as well. I would make sure to book as it does Get busy. Lots of birthdays on. It was my daughters 10th and the entertainers come to the table to sing happy birthday. It is done really well . They sing a song sing happy birthday and then change costumps before doing it again to another party. My daughter had a ball. Suitable for all ages. They have a shoe for 9 o click ish which was quite good. Staff are really nice. We had a great time even met Stavros Flatley from Britain's got talent who eats up there too. I thought it was was going to be expensive which it was not, definitely worth a visit.",,
"On the recommendation of a friend who lived in Paphos my Wife and visited Far Mama's and were not disappointed. A warm welcome with details of 2 for 1 cocktails and a 10% discount were made clear to us. We both ordered the Mama's size fillet steak which were cooked as requested and I struggled to finish mine...though I did manage in the end. There was entertainment during the evening though the highlight for us (apart from the food) was the excellent service and friendliness of the two waitresses Megan and Christina who were fabulous.....good luck at University to you both when you go in September. We would highly recommend Fat Mama's, but be advised it does get busy!!",,
We always go to fat mamas as others in my party enjoy it I always struggle to choose but I end up having ribs which where very fatty and not as good as I remember but we will go back as it’s ok as others in my family enjoyed it. staff are friendly and it is fun with lots of things for kids and you can now pay in sterling which is good if you run out of euros happy visiting,,
"Went here twice during our holiday to Paphos. The food is fantastic and the portions are fantastic. I had mixed fajitas on my first visit and pizza on my second. The cocktails are buy one get one fee from 6:00 til 7:00. I loved the entertainment, especially fat mama and big Willy.",,
Went here 3 nights out of 10 gets very busy at times but well worth the wait the pizzas are the best I've had and the burgers they were huge as were the puddings very good value for money on are last day we went early as we were flying home so went a 5 was very quite then there was offers on certain drinks buy 1 get 1 free plus 10% of your order.There is also a bit of entertainment aswell,,
Nice afternoon with friends good service cool drinks and nice place with good people. Good prices. Recommended,,
"Visited in June. Lively place, ongoing entertainment as you dine. It was busy and had to wait for a table. The food was ok, we had homemade burgers, fajitas and pizzas, portions are big and prices reasonable. Staff are very good and quick.",,
We stopped for a meal during our stay in Paphos at the start of July. The restaurant was very busy and seems to be connected to the restaurant next door (Willy's). There was music playing in the background and at random times a dance troupe would come and do a dance routine to certain songs. Later in the evening the dance troupe done a 20 minutes (approx) routine which included fire eating. The food was reasonably priced and tasty and the staff were good. The restaurant was busy but at no time did you feel pressured to leave. Fat mama's is a good place to stop at and if you time it right they will throw in a free show.  I would definitely stop here again when we are next in Paphos,,
Fat mamas is Italian food and Willy’s is tex mex and they give you both menus so u can mix n match if you wish . Walking along it looks like 2 seperate restUrants but it’s the same place  We chose a nachos starter to share and it was to die for . Home made nachos loads of cheese jalapeño and mince  For my main I switched to Italian and had superb cannelloni dish  My friend had Mediterranean chicken delicious too  Great food reasonably priced and friendly staff,,
"We came here because it’s always busy but it was a strange experience. The food was really tasty and and the waiters seemed helpful. What we weren’t sure about was the dancing, singing and singing to people every 15 minutes. It just seemed unnecessary.",,
"I went with 4 friends and had some food from the italian menu as well as some food from the american menu. yes! they have 2 type of menu with a lot of food. The food was delicious !!! the service was impeccable and the waiters very nice and funny! I think it is a british restaurant (from talking withe waiters). I don t have to mention how big the portions are. We each had a different kind of food and we still got to take some home!!! So i recommend!!! with all the heart! if you go to Pafos, pleaca visit Fat Mama’s!!!",,
"Despite going to Pathos for the last 4 years, we had never visited Fat Mamma's. We finally did this time. We were a family of 6 and managed to get a table straight away, despite being busy. What can say?  Straight away we were made to feel welcome and wasn't hassled while looking at the menu. When the food came it was superb. Generous portions that was very tasty. I had the fillet steak and it was just cooked perfect. I'm so glad we made revisit and when we're back in Pathos we will definitely visit again. Highly recommended",,
It was ok if you like American fast food portions size good Spare ribs good and lots very busy Be prepared to wait,,
The place is very warm and friendly. The staff is amazing.. I read some awful comments down bellow from people that probably never ate microwaved food or ribs in their life.. or they just had a bad day. The best ribs I ever tried!! The owner is very friendly and is actually working in there.. they are very simple clean and Delicious . BRAVO,,
"Had dinner here with a few girls.    Cocktails buy one get one free before 7 was good to get the evening started.    Varied menu, plenty of staff and entertainment    Food was okay probably a bit overpriced for what it really was.    The girls dance and performed during our time there. Just a pity they stand in the middle of the floor looking into the restaurant rather than being inside and performing out to the customers. While we were there a guy from the bar was helping out. Note lose the chewing gum when you are dancing it really isn't that good a look.",,
"If your looking for a 3 course meal, you’ll have to pace yourself at fat mammas. There is plenty to choose from and it all sounds delicious, but don’t let your eyes be bigger than your belly, because the portions are on the larger side.    We loved the nachos, the nacho chips were different than we were use to which was a pleasant surprise. The lasagne main comes with chips and is gorgeous, as was the burgers. The drinks offers were great value for money and the hostess is keen for customers to get in the offer time which differs from the typical delaying to charge you full price I have experienced in other places.    There is a combination of open air and covered seating with both smoking and non smoking. And I’m passing we saw in the later evening they provide excellent live shows and entertainment.    The only thing that let it down was the customer service. The waitresses were often grouped together giggling and mucking around, or talking to their friends who had walked past while customers sat unchecked or waiting. While we was there early and before the full flow of the night (5pm-ish) I still expected a bit more attention rather than trying to get the attention of 4 waitresses passing for a drink and waiting 10 minuets, whilst they chatted at the beginning of the night. We had an odd experience were we asked for two more glasses of tap water and was refused and told fat mamas only provides bottled water, but we asked another waitress and got them bought straight over, and we was not charged water on the bill.    Overall we really enjoyed the environment and meal and would happily return.",,
"There is a lot of hype over this restaurant, we decided to see what it was all about. We did not have to wait for a table although it was rather busy. It reminds me of an American Diner. I had a chicken pasta dish, but the small portion and my husband a pizza. Neither were of a high quality, but edible. The entertainment which we were not expecting was good and enjoyable, one of the girls could do with smiling though, she looked so fed up!  All in all an average night but I would not rush to return.",,
I went with my wife. We had shrimps and lamp chops. We simply loved it! I don’t know what else to add so I will just punch some letters... ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ There ... are you satisfied trip advisor?,,
This is one brillant restaurant the staff are so nice and the food is brillant quantity of food is amazing if you like a good feed. The entertainment during your meal is brillant too,,
I have been visiting this restaurant whilst on holiday for about 15 years and I have never been disappointed. It’s good food at a good price and huge portions. My kids have grown up enjoying their visits and now my family’s very young children are also enjoying it. Well worth a visit.,,
Fantastic food lovely place really clean staff lovely highly recommend it 😁 would definitely go back there for a meal 😁,,
Our party of 7 ordered a variety of dishes & as we waited our drinks arrived. There was an offer to buy a beer & get one free as with soft drinks. 2 drinks were placed in front of each of us. It was 32 degrees incidentally. I asked the waitress to bring my second beer once iid finished the first. I was told it was open now so she wouldn’t take or back! I ordered a rack of ribs from the ‘Willy’s rib shack menu’ thinking they were somewhat of a featur. Wet ribs arrived looking like they’d slid out of a bag. Worst dining experience in years. It was cheap. That’s the only positive I have.,,
Visited here after first visiting 8 years ago. The food was amazing and the portion sizes were crazy! Definitely worth your money. Its a busy restaurant so pre book if you have a large group. There was 2 of us and we were seated within 10 minutes. Would definitely recommend. I honestly dont understand the negative reviews!,,
We ate here and I had the Cowboy ribs only have these if you have a huge appetite they are delishous but there is a lot of them. The entertainment is brilliant.,,
"Food was average - doughy undercooked garlic bread with too much unmelted cheese, overcooked burger, overcooked steak in the fajitas. To top it all, the service was dreadful. Left us sitting for about 25 minutes with the dessert menu - in the end we decided to leave. Won't be back!",,
"As the title of the review says, the food was ok. Large portions but lacking in flavour. The service is excellent and I would recommend here for families as they provide entertainment for children. It is not suited for couples, such as our visit.",,
"Family visit lovely food really enjoyed, big portions only ate half! Would definitely return and recommend",,
"Me and my step-daughter visited here in June. If you eat between 1800-1900 cocktails are 2-4-1 and you get 10% off bill. I had fillet steak cooked in coca-cola wow it was amazing everything was cooked to perfection and tasted great. The staff were very friendly,polite and helpful if your staying in Paphos you really must make a trip to this restaurant",,
"Having had the worst meal ever down the road just last night, it was great to end up walking in here tonight. The steak was amazing and very well priced (€26 for approx 12oz fillet). The jacket potato was very fresh too. My girlfriend had the Mediterranean chicken dish and loved it. In an area that a lot of places seem to cut costs through buying poor quality produce, it is great to find a place that sells good quality meat and well cooked. We will 100% be back",,
"Visited Fat Mama’s many times over the years, the food is just as tasty and plentiful every year. With the added dance shows it makes for a great night of food and entertainment.",,
"Fat Mama's is definitely a restaurant that NEEDS to be visited in Paphos. Menu has plenty of choice, even has two menu's one for Italian and one for american. Me and my boyfriend were going to get two starters and two mains but the waitress kindly advised we just shared the one starter because the portions are huge and we were so happy she said that because the portions at this place are ridiculous. We had nachos to share for a starter which was huge and delicious and I had chicken fajitas and my boyfriend had the small ribs ( but they certainly didn't look small AT ALL) we both absolutely loved our meals. Great portion sizes but don't get carried away with getting loads food because trust me you won't be able to eat all of it. The thing that makes this restaurant different is the entertainment, it was so good to watch the girls do a burlesque show as we ate our meal, made the night even better. Staff were also so friendly and so lovely. Overall 10/10, recommend this place to anyone visiting Paphos!",,
"Great food, portions are massive so make sure you go for the small portions! Entertainment for the kids, great choice of American and Italian food-something for everyone! Very fresh and waiting staff attentive. Highly recommended",,
"Fat Mama’s was great one of the best meals and entertainment we had whilst on holiday. The service was good but the entertainment was in another ball park. 3 dancers to be honest I am not so sure what they called themselves but they would come out every 5-10 minutes with a new routine and then at the end done a straight 15-20 show which was fun to watch.    I had chicken wings and nachos to start and billy the kid steak for main, I loved it and had no complaints what so ever.    All the staff are lovely especially Lane who is on the door welcoming people and showing them to there tables. We are a fantastic chat and she gave us the history into Fat Mama’s which was cool    100% you must eat here as I will certainly",,
Very busy place but food was great. Very large menu to choose from. Entertainment was fun. Recommended,,
"This is our 2nd visit to Fat Mamas after first trying it last year. There are a choice of 2 menus which you can mix and match. We ordered the nachos to share (one portion between two) and glad we did as the portion was so big. For the main I had enchiladas (x2!! With salsa, guacamole and sour cream) my partner had a spicy burger and we both were very impressed. Again massive portions for the main we couldn’t finish it. (See photos)  For desert we had the cheesecake and banana split. This was lovely too!    This restaurant is NOT for people looking for a qui meal. There is entertainment which we found very good however saw others who didn’t seem as impressed. They have some fantastic dancers who come out and sing happy birthday to people and then put on entertainment later on in the night.    Overall very impressed, would 100% go back and recommend Fat Mamas!",,
"Imaginative choice of two menus with something for everyone. Staff attentive, frequently checking that all is well, top ups and if any problems. Dance show energetic and polished.",,
"We visited this restaurant during our visit to Paphos after it being recommended by a friend. I have to say It far exceeded my expectations both in the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff. We ordered mussels for starters and they were the best I have ever eaten, really fresh and in the most delicious cream sauce. The steaks here are also really tasty and if you come before seven there are 2 for one offers on soft drinks and cocktails and 10% off the bill if you pay cash! Throughout our visit, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and I highly recommend anyone planning a visit to Paphos to drop in and enjoy their wonderful food and hospitality.",,
"didnt book but got a table immediately, staff very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent, we didnt have starters as we know from a past visit that its very hard to eat both, two of us had steak which melted in the mouth, husband had ribs which we helped to finish. The floor show was great, the 3 girls are very talented.  I have been looking forward to this meal for 12 months and I must say I wasnt dissapointed. Keep up the good work guys",,
"The food was fairly average in taste, not spectacular but not awful. The portions are large, which is reflected in the price",,
Went here a couple of nights but the entertainment was the same. The place is a fun night out if you like traditional Greek dancing. The drinks aren't watered down and well priced,,
"Me and my partner have had a few meals at Fat Mamas and there is no error in the place at all. The staff are chatty and polite, even at busy periods which is almost all the time, there is never an empty seat in the house! The food is to die for but beware people with little appetites.. this is not for you to order a mamas portion, there is so much food, but every mouthful is like a drop of heaven!  They provide entertainment and just all around a happy place to eat.",,
"Really nice place to visit as a family entertainment great and gives the advantage over other places, food is really nice but I think I had maybe higher than average expectations.",,
"We decided our last night we would eat at bug mamas they have two menus we opted for the grill one of willys. The waitress came over and was lovely from the start and we ordered our drinks. When she came to see if we were ready to order she had taken down what we wanted but then said are you both very hungry (strange to say) but what was so good about her point was the starters are so big we would have not eaten our main. This for us is very good customer service as we would have not enjoyed or finished our main course, so we shared a starter and i see what she meant.    It was so nice to have a laugh with the team there and then they had a show within then restaurant singing and dancing.    The food was cooked to perfection sizzling steak and the cowboy bbq burger were enormous and hard to finsh.    The bill with 3 beers, coffee starter 2 mins only 50 euro.    Would highly recommend a trip here in paphos.    Thank you big mamas.",,
"Had the starter sharing platters which was huge followed by one chilli con carne that we shared . To big for two people. However great flavour, staff and atmosphere. Good entertainment.",,
We visited after reading reviews on TA. It was also recommended by a local. We were acknowledged on arrival and sat down straight away. The pina colada cocktails we ordered were just awful. The cream they used had curdled with the pineapple juice and there was no taste of alcohol. They were sent back undrinkable. In my opinion the food was average I had the ribs and although they were big they seemed to sacrifice quantity for quality which is a shame. My partner had enchiladas which she says were lovely. So it goes to show they can do good food. There was entertainment which was OK at least they made the effort. Would I go again? probably not.,,
I had the most amazing food tonight the cherry tomatoes chicken everything was perfect and considering I had a small portion it was quite a portion! Entertainment was refreshing was great to have something different. My partner had the ribs he did find the sauce a tad bland however he said there was an unbelievable amount of meat and the price was very good. Very helpful for gluten free too.,,
"I have eaten here a few times and always enjoyed the evening. The staff are very friendly and always polite. My toddler loves the dancers and meeting the characters in costumes. The food is nice but if you order the big portion it usually means you get twice as many chips. The only thing that I find frustrating is the staff leave you stood outside to make the restaurant look busier. Sometimes there are clearly people doing nothing and tables available. Apart from that I fully recommend a visit, you won’t be disappointed.",,
Been here twice now this week and on both occasions meals were excellent. You also get a show too. All staff warm and welcoming. Recommend the snakebite fillet steak,,
"Visited this restaurant a couple of times on our holiday as it was just so good! All staff were amazing, very friendly and attentive. The food was brilliant, we tried the burgers on our first visit and the second time I had the halloumi fajitas and my partner had the cannelloni. They have entartament throughout the night which was fab. Would highly recommend this place and would definitely go back again.",,
"OMG best ribs ever! We ate here early evening, I had steak, Hubby had ribs, we were embarrassed at how quickly we ate our food it was soo good. Staff are really nice and friendly, food is fabulous.",,
Made to wait in a queue while a table was found for party of 6 adults and 3 kids even though we had booked. Waited ten minutes ... could see loads of empty tables and pointed this out to waiters but they seemed to not care. 5 more minutes went by and we stood queuing in the heat ... until we left .... went 2 doors down and had a lovely meal ... think fat mama s like having large queues outside to make the place look busy ..,,
We have been visiting Paphos for the last 15 years and always driven past and said we must go one day we went with our friends last Wednesday and we where greeted by friendly and dancers the food didn't disappoint the steaks where fabulous,,
Recommended Good service Plentiful portions Cocktails ok not the best I’ve tried Good entertainment Value for money.,,
Well what can I say the best meal that me and my partner have had abroad in a long time. The staff were brilliant. The entertainment was great the food was out of this world. We went twice it was that fantastic and both times had a food coma. We was stuffed after starter and main but it would be rude not to do desert!!!,,
"everytime i travell to Paphos I always head to Fat Mamastha the RIBS are amazing, although i was all inclusive still managed to find my way to Fat Mamas",,
Cam for a meal 3 adults and 2 children looked at reviews on TA and the fact the portions were massive. Service was ok but not amazing and as for portion sizes would say they are no larger than any ware else I have eaten. The small show was good and the food was hot and tasted good. Did no live up to they hype on here for me personally.,,
"This place is amazing, food huge portions we went for half ribs small plate and couldn’t finish them. Had the sharing platter starter between four of us. Staff fantastic, xcellent value for money",,
"We visit Fat Mamas each year we go to Paphos. The food is always good, massive portions so go for the small option if able too.  There is always entertainment throughout your meal from some of the waiters which is enjoyable to watch.  Definitely worth a visit.",,
Had three great meals here came recommended and had seen on trip advisor very busy but once we were seated and ordered didn’t have long to wait on the food. Well worth the wait. Staff very friendly and dancing girls show excellent as well.,,
Went with another couple for a meal. Service was fantastic and food outstanding!! Then the staff all start singing and dancing! Great night. Will definitely be going back in July!!,,
"Great food and massive portions so after our starters, we struggled to eat our mains. I recommend sharing the nachos between more than 3 people as the mains are very big. The entertainment was good - they had 3 dancers and if you have are celebrating a special occasion, tell them and they’ll make it extra special for you!    Taxi’s pick you up from the other side of the road so easy to get to!",,
"Went here 3 times while we were in Cyprus, good food , good fun in didn't believe it till I had seen it for myself, there was people queuing to get in but it was worth it.",,
"Good food as usual with some entertainment, central location and very enjoyable for families, worth a visit while you’re in Paphos",,
Very friendly restaurant with dancers and singing every night. We were lucky enough to see Stavropol Flatlley perform which was very amusing. Food portions are large and tasty,,
"After reading reviews we decided to try whilst out in paphos. One word AMAZING!    The prices are very reasonable, and the food was so nice we are going back again before we leave to come home tomorrow!    Entertainment was good! And the staff were very friendly!!!",,
Food was fantastic with a little entertainment thrown in.always very busy but worth a visit.will be back,,
"heard lots of people comment how good this restaurant was. it was so busy that we had to go for an early meal to get a table. didn’t know that you could reserve a table. plenty of food on the plate but felt it wasn’t as good as a TGI Friday (which is the type of food they serve). so if you want that type of food then go to a TGI Friday, of which there was one situated in the shopping mall 10 minutes away. staff was very nice and friendly though. just felt it had less choice than a TGI Friday type restaurant but nothing particularly wrong with the food",,
"Such a great lively atmosphere, really big portions and lovely food. Would definitely recommend to all ages!",,
"Lovely food, huge portions, great location, plenty to keep kids entertained with the dancers and nail painting/ tattoos. Highly recommend for a family dinner.",,
If you want a good laugh go to this place. Grey entertainment. Dancers. Singers. The whole sherbang. Food was ok. A little over seasoned but really good value.,,
"We enjoyed two visits to Fat Mama's during our recent holiday to Paphos and both were excellent. The portion sizes were huge, you really don't need to order the larger size unless you have a VERY big appetite! The food quality was amazing, I had fillet steak and it was the best I've had, cooked exactly as requested, just delicious! Although this restaurant is extremely busy the service is really high class. The cabaret is really enjoyable and we were lucky enough to see Stavros Flatley during our visit which was just brilliant!! This restaurant is very family focused and can get very busy, there were always long queues for a table (but worth the wait!). I look forward to visiting again on our next visit to Paphos :0)",,
"Visited here one night whilst on holiday to watch a dance act and also sample the ribs which did not disappoint,good portions of food,nice and warm and well presented by the polite staff,prices where okay too and place was clean,worth a visit!",,
This place needs no introduction its a fab place good food good acts and we was lucky enough to have been in the restaurant when stavros flatly (BGT) entered surprising everyone in the place brilliant night thanks.,,
"We booked here for our daughters 1st birthday as stavros flatly was performing!!! Absolutely amazing.. Tje entertainment throughout the night was spot on, with performances every look half hour which breaks up the evening.. Staff are amazing, entertainment spot on and the food is so nice, nice big portions... Deffinetly going again, well we live here so would be rude not too........ Keep up the good work FAT MAMAS",,
We ate at Fat Mama’s last night and ended up staying there most of the night because the entertainment was so good. They have dancers on every night. Last night it was a cabaret theme & they had an appearance from Stavros Flatly. It was great fun.    There is so much choice for food as they hand you two different menus when you come in. One for American food and one for Italian. I had Fajitas from the American menu and they were beautiful (massive portions though). My partner had the BBQ ribs which are offered in two sizes & we then shared the biggest slab of chocolate cake I have ever seen in my life.    The staff were very lovely and we noticed people were queuing for a table for most of the night (I think they stopped letting people in after 9pm so that the customers they had could enjoy the Cabernet).    All round excellent review for this one.  Thanks very much!,,
Completely average. Need to improve massively. One waiter rolled his eyes when I asked for something,,
We have been here many times and never fail to enjoy ourselves. Large menu will cater for most. Portions are good. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The nightly entertainment provided by the staff is great to watch,,
"I couldn’t change the date to when we actually visited in October 2015, but it doesn’t matter. We were in Paphos for my Aunty’s wedding and we decided to dine here the night before. It was absolutely amazing, still to this day my boyfriend claims it is his favourite meal he’s ever had. I had the sea bass and my boyfriend had a steak. They were both cooked perfectly and were satisfyingly full after. It was also two for one cocktails so I enjoyed mojitos with my meal. I 100% recommend this place if you dine out in Paphos. They also have entertainment which was a nice treat for us too. The mascots were rather funny and the dancers were good. Would definitely return if I’m ever back in Paphos",,
"We had heard good things about Fat Mamas and arrived roughly at 6pm, we were easily seated. Service was quick and efficient. Between 6-7pm they do a cash only payment offer with buy one get one free cocktails and 10% off the bill, the only thing that bothered me was that they arrived with 4 cocktails instead of us getting one each, they automatically give you two each, I didn’t like that and felt forced to drink it that way. They have two menus either Italian or American and you can mix and match. They also offer a children’s menu. The food was not bad, we had nachos, burgers, ribs and steak all of which were tasty and cooked well. There is entertainment provided by three dancers which was slightly awkward as it didn’t seem to fit the theme of the restaurant but gave us a laugh so maybe that’s the point. Would we go back? Yes.",,
Fat Mamas has two menus to choose from so you can’t go wrong for something you will like. We visited with the grandkids and children and had a ball. The girls put on a really good dance show at intervals during the evening which really lifts everyone and the kids get a real buzz. Good steaks and burgers with plenty of side options. Reccomended if your down that way.,,
"Oh wow this was one of the best steaks I have ever had. I'm trying to diet so was offered rice and broccoli instead of chips which I was very pleased about!  I hate dancers and shows but I actually enjoyed the dancers as they were subtle and only on every 20 mins or so.  The 2 for 1 cocktails is on between 6 - 7 each night and the strawberry daquiris were delicious!  The staff were amazing, we went two nights and we were recognised the second time and even remembered our order! (we had to get steaks twice!!)  Would come back to Paphos especially to eat here!",,
Second rate food pathetic dancers it's a place to avoid walk past and don't stop there is a brilliant Greek taverna next door with amazing food and service,,
"Loved this place, the food and service was excellent. Family of 6 are here and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. They had abit of entertainment, the food was delicious and drinks when ordered arrived quickly. Would definitely recommend.",,
"The first evening we went in here was very busy and after sitting for a while left as we were unattended. However we decided to try another evening and were well attended. We both took burgers, which is an unusual choice for us, but they were excellent and definitely home made. Also when I asked about the house wine, they let me have a taste, which unfortunately was not to my taste. However we selected another soft drink. Nothing was too much bother. There were also females dancing and folk dressed up in disney clothes. Probably good for children tool.",,
"Fat Mamas and Willys are a must if you go to Paphos,we were there before 7 pm,and had 2 for1 on our cocktails,we ordered the small meal and only just managed to finish them,The food is a choice of Italian and American,Staff are friendly,food is hot and tasty.",,
"Enjoyed the meal a lot to choice from, staff lovely, food good and hot, some entertainment which was a little annoying while trying to eat and talk overall good place.",,
Food was good but huge portions! Entertainment was good and gives it a great atmosphere. Staff were attentive too which was good. Happy to chat,,
"Wow, the food here is incredible! Massive portions, you will definatley not leave hungry! We got the nachos to start, my word they were phenomenal. Fajitas and steak for main, again very tasty food. Very friendly staff and the added bonus of a show being put on was Great! Will 100% return when we go back to Paphos",,
Lovely food at a good price. I ate here while holidaying in paphos and it was lovely. Friendly staff and my order was taken quickly no waiting around. There is a smoking area and non smoking area for people to choose when being seated. Lots of food choices on the menu to suit everyone. I will attach a picture of my meal for you to see.,,
"Great place, great and very handsome stuff and delicious food and drinks!!! Greetings from Warsaw!!! :-)",,
"We had heard nothing but amazing reviews about this restaurant so we had to come try it out. It didn’t disappoint amazing service, the dancers were so good they even came out and announced we had just got married and gave us a glass of champagne which was a lovely gesture. The food was so delicious, big portion sizes too. Thanks for a lovely evening we will be back next year :)",,
"This restaurant will never be beaten,I used to come here as a kid 20 years ago have just returned with my husband and children and wow nothing has changed still fantastic food and entertainment and good prices to,anyone that wants a lovely meal needs to visit fat mamas would recommend to everyone",,
"Best ribs I’ve ever had, staff came to table too often two mouthful of drink and asked if wanted another !!    Entertainment is ok if that’s the kind of thing you like while your eating very loud but portion sizes are huge so starve yourself if you want to finish your meal    All in all the food is good , very American style",,
As we work in the area we thought to get something easy made. We tried the make your own pizza. It just melted in your mouth unbelivable. Definetly going back for a meal,,
"Fantastic, family orientated atmosphere. Staff magnificent A MUST visit when in Paphos. Found the entertainment great for the kids, people watching on the Tomb of the Kings Road fascinating too. Extremely reasonable prices for such a well heeled established restaurant. thanks again.",,
Wanting great atmosphere and fine food.Look no further plenty to choose from with two great menus suiting everyones tastes.  During the evening you are entertained by the dancing girls including fire eating!  Prices are middle to high dependkng on your choice with bottles of wine around 15 euros.  Staff are very helpful with the owner on hand to give you a warm welcome.  The only negative for me was being asked if i wanted to add a tip to my bill when paying by credit card.  Overall visited twice whilst on holiday and enjoyed both visits.,,
"Could not fault the food or the service here, the fillet steaks are very good. All staff very attentive, making it a memorable evening, and the prices are very reasonable. Thanks for a great birthday celebration.",,
As always a fab evening. Had a great night with the family. Excellent food and the dancing girls were fantastic. Made our night. Thank you Fat Mamas we will be back for sure 😎,,
"Have been coming to fat mamas for years every time we’re in Paphos, love the food and entertainment! Portions are huge and the food always brings us back, on this visit we were pleasantly surprised with a lovely server named Layn who spoke away to us and made us feel welcome! Honestly one of the kindest servers I’ve ever met.",,
We went to this restaurant while in paphos menu looked really good so we went in to order as we were sat at table 32 waiting for our meal I noticed that there was ants on the table & also my friend opposite was scratching his head so we both looked up & the ceiling was covered in ants so we called a member of staff over to explain this & asked to be moved which they did this was on the 2 night of our holiday & we didn’t return after that,,
"Friendly staff, huge portions of food and good advice regarding the menu/portions. Received leftovers to go",,
"So much food for so little money, great quality food combined with fabulous staff and entertainment! Would highly recommend a visit. But definitely pace yourself and don’t eat for the rest of the day!",,
Waked past on a walk one night and liked the look of this place large queue dancing staff so we decided to call back next night.went quite early to avoid queue and got table wasn’t that expensive and food was good entertainment good but got the feeling staff where a bit bored of the dancing and singing every time the music started and felt rushed so table could be cleaned ready for next customer like I said food good but I wouldn’t queue up for it .,,
Excellent staff really friendly and took good care of us and children. Food was fantastic and delivered promptly. Even had entertainment in the restaurant. Although I often see large queues waiting to get in so book in advance if going during the busy season.,,
This was by far the best restaurant around paphos it’s two restaurant in one (Willy’s ribs) went to both and had the best steak I’ve ever had in my life from there 💯,,
Omg!!! we enjoy our meal there at night it is very busy during summer time but such a funny night !!!! We had fun laughing the waitresses made a show not only them the show was fab and funny!! Great time!!!,,
"Awesome food, great atmosphere. I got the fajitas and as you can tell by the picture it was enough to feed two. There are little acts of entertainment on too, I would definitely recommend!",,
"I visited fat mamas over 3 years ago when I made my first trip to pap his! The restaurant was recommended by a friend who had been before. By god was I not disappointed! The atmosphere was great, very friendly staff on arrival and all the way through our service. The food was delicious! While I was there I had the Nachos, one of the BBQ burgers and the beautiful apple pies for dessert! I came with my family and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food! Would definitely return if I ever came back to paphos!",,
Great place good friendly staff great food best starve yourself all day as portions are mega good bar music on during summer months,,
"Apparently this restaurant has been known for years to be very good and have long lines outside the premisses with people waiting for a free table. I went there with a group of 5 and i was surprised i couldn't find what made the place so special.    One of my friends was displeased with their steak, while i had an average burger myself. Service was also very slow for the place being only half full at the time.    Not keen in trying it again. :/",,
If you want to have a great night for the Kids this is the place . Great fun and entertainment and nice food . Don't order too much as big portions ..,,
"Went here as a couple, one evening of our holiday in Paphos and it didn't disappoint. Serving ribs, burgers, steak etc. it was very filling and service was very attentive! The entertainment was great, a fun night out all in all!",,
"Average food and drink, there are better restaurants around in paphos. Wasn't busy when we were there.",,
"We often visit as my husband loves the steaks (and has limited taste buds for anything else). I do try various dishes on the menu to be more adventurous.    There are two sizes on the menu, normal or large.... normal takes some stamina to get through ..... and large....well you might need a doggy bag cos it's one hell of a portion if you haven't got what it takes to get through it.    Very reasonably priced food and drinks with special offers for the early birds.    Easy access for disabled but like most of the toilets in the older restaurants there could be an issue here.    The staff are mega friendly and like a laugh with a bit of entertainment.    The layout is basic, but it's set up for fast, easy service with no compromise on the food.    The menu is set for meat eaters with a America trend, but does have veggie options or Italian selections.",,
This place is great for kids - we saw a lot of families having a great time. We were 3 adults though and found the food a bit disappointing.    Portions were ridiculously huge - such a waste of food. And a bit flavourless. My friend had a pizza and it was a bit over cooked with way too much topping. Drinks menu was good and service was very good - really friendly staff.    They have entertainment - girls dancing. I found it a bit cringey - they were great dancers but it did feel like it was an excuse to put some attractive women in a few skimpy costumes and I didn't feel that comfortable watching. Where were the male dancers to balance it out?!,,
Nice restaurant for a good meal and to have some fun with friends while u watch the great show ...i will visit again the only dissapointment is the slow service but it was very busy during our visit,,
"Loved this place , great fun and fab food , good prices.best to book so you are not disappointed. They celebrate your birthday by singing and also tribute acts there later on in the evenings .",,
Typical American diner. Food quality not good. Entertaining for children and adults not bad. They make everyone wait outside at the entrance even though there are available tables.,,
"Very good restaurant with dancing and singing while you are eating. The only problem is you get too much to eat, you could probably share your meal it is that large.Very friendly staff and a very enjoyable evening.",,
Another excellent night at Fat Mama's. So much fun and fabulous steaks. Thanks girls for entertaining my party.,,
"The food here is okay, reasonably priced and tasty - nothing to write home about. The drinks also a reasonable. The big draw here is the promise of entertainment which consists of a singer (quite good) and then a cabaret act which is something to watch but you can see that not ALL of the dancers want to be there-",,
The food was excellent and if you eat during Happy Hour on the Coctails you get 2 for 1 - I had the Dirty Waiter and it was so refreshing - the ribs were fantastic and a very good portion,,
"very good food at very reasonable prices,very popular & in a good location,staff very friendly and entertainment as well during the evening.",,
Staff were so lovely and so much entertainment!! Great portions and very tasty! Definitely recommend but don’t expect a quiet night!,,
"What a let down, we were really looking forward to this one but with the staff having an argument over whose table we were (yes, a proper argument) it wasn't a great start. The first waitress was fab but after she was moved off us we were largely ignored. Asking for some black pepper for the pasta seemed odd to them and I was tapped on the shoulder and it was slammed down on the table. As it happens the rubbish battery operated pepper mill didn't help the bland and rubbery pasta taste any better, had it not been a chore get a waiter I would have sent it back earlier, shame we didn't even get offered a second drink to wash it down with. The portions are massive so you get a lot for your money, but it was voted the worst ribs out of 5 different places over the holiday, they seemed fatty and pre cooked with the sauce poured over. All 4 of us were so disappointed that no one wanted to stay for the Halloween party. We won't be back.",,
"Not the place for a romantic evening getaway, but if you like a bit of table entertainment whilst enjoying your food and drink this is a great place to eat. Large portions are the order of day so don't go overboard on your starter!Good value for money a Mr plenty of choices from two different menus. Great place for families and celebrations.",,
"We had heard great things about this restaurant so decided to go. I think it best suits families with younger children for the entertainment that’s provided. We had to queue to get in so I advise booking if that’s even possible to avoid this. The staff were lovely & the food portions generous but I wasn’t amazed by the quality of the food, it was okay.",,
Myself and my boyfriend were staying just down the road and walked past to see that the place had a buzzing atmosphere. We said that we must go there for dinner as the menu has many options and there were lots of  Guests so it was clearly popular. Our food came out very quickly and the portions were generous. The steak we ordered was very poor and is what we would call a ‘dogs dinner’. I’ve also had much better pizzas that have been cooked from frozen. It’s like they concentrate on huge portions and quick service but the food has no effort put into it. Wouldn’t return. Very friendly staff but when I put my hand up for service it took a few minutes for anyone to notice me.,,
Went here with a party of 28 excellent service and entertainment highly recommend the ribs (cowboy portion) would definitely return if came back to paphos,,
"We went to Fat Mamas twice the last time we came to Paphos, 13 years ago, when we got married and before we had kids. When we booked to go back this year we couldn’t wait to take our 3 children there, Although we were worried that it wouldn’t live up to our expectations, but we haven’t been disappointed. In our 2 week holiday we have visited twice. Our children loved it. Our daughter said they should change their name to ‘heaven’. Lol. The food portions are huge! And the ribs are AMAZING! I had the chicken with broccoli and tagliatelle in blue cheese sauce (which I’m pretty sure is what I had when we visited 13 years ago!) and it was delicious. We will always make sure we visit Fat Mamas when we visit paphos. We’ve booked to come back next year and will definitely be back. Also, I must mention that while we’ve been on holiday our daughter has been using our money to sort out what notes and coins she needs to pay the bill. Tonight when she did it we didn’t pay much attention as it was throwing it down and we were getting ready for our taxi to pull up outside. When we were half way back in the taxi, the driver had a call from Fat Mamas (my husband had left our taxi drivers card on our table) to say we had paid €50 too much! So we went back for it. But it was very good of them to go out of their way to get in touch with us to let us know. Excellent service, lovely staff, delicious food. Thank you",,
A great family restaurant with entertainment and extras for the kids. Good food but HUGE helpings this Fat Mummas!,,
Good Fun restaurant on the strip with good dancers and waiters the food and drinks were reasonably priced and served very quickly. Burgers were good but chips under cooked. Did tell waitress but she just said oh...  would have made a bigger deal but was just so happy not to be eating the terrible food at our hotel....,,
we went there for a meal with my 2 year old grandson. the show was god the food fantastic the girls dancing were good with my grandson who wnted to dance with them as he stripped to his nappy to join in thanks for beening so good with him will recomend the food to everyone,,
"Well worth a visit the food was fabulous just what you need sometimes when you get fed up of hotel meals...  Reasonably priced and massive portion sizes, so for those of you with a good appetite like me it is well worth a trip..  when we left the place was full and lively and once you have visited you will see why..  Great little place.",,
Really good atmosphere at this place and the staff are very helpful! BELIEVE what you read about the portions as they are huge! Will definitely return when back in Paphos!,,
Great food Good entertainment Nice staff Average prices You won't come out hungery What more could you ask for All in all good restaurant,,
AMaZING! Lovely food and drinks. Everything was cooked to perfection. Especially burgers and other dishes. Staff were friendly. And the caberae show= Spectacular! Definitely go here If you ever get the chance.Thanks Fat Mamas for an amazing meal.,,
We went twice. American style menu with big portions. Food and service were excellent. There was a cabaret of three dancers who were very talented and fun to watch. Very good value and great atmosphere. Highly recommended,,
"Took our 2 granddaughters. We all had a fun night, nice food & good entertainment. Pre booked our table & requested to be seated at the front for a good viewe of the entertainment.",,
"Food was great and the added singing and dancing every half hour in the evening was an added bonus, would definitely eat there again. Would definitely note that a full sized pizza is very large so would opt for the regular sized one. The mocktails were great and if you go after 6 you get a free one with every one you buy, definitely worth it. Prices were good, food was even better and atmosphere was amazing. No dress code, we walked in in flip flops board shorts and T-Shirts.",,
Have been returning here for the last 20 years because you always get great food and excellent service. Shows are not quite as good as they used to be but fun for families and children alike.,,
"We decided to make fat mamma’s our place to for wedding anniversary meal though the food was good but the staff could have been a bit more attentive things were a bit slow, they did come and congratulate us and brought us a drink when the show was on and we thank them for that as it was nice we had an enjoyable meal. This is very busy place if you get in before 7.00 pm there is a 10% discount and booking you have to book before 7.00 pm well worth a visit",,
This is a great restaurant food is to die for I ordered a small portion omg it was huge couldn't eat it all good prices too,,
"Cocktails very good but aimed at families with Fat Mama making a cartoon appearance at 7pm....singers, dancers, evening entertainment, we had an early evening drink and moved on to somewhere a bit more authentic!",,
We went here for our wedding anniversary meal and were celebrated by the dancers and staff ... We always go here when in Cyprus we just love it x,,
Just passing. Decided to stop for a meal. Glad we did it was delicious. Every now and then MUSIC volume would go up and dancers would come on adding to the enjoyment. Only restaurant in Paphos we visited twice. 2nd meal was as good as the first. Will visit again next time we're in Cyprus,,
Decent food at decent prices. 3 courses for 13 euros was a good price although there was cheaper places about.,,
"Visited here once during our stay. The food was really good. Very varied menu, crayons for kids, and reasonably priced. Staff were also friendly. However was quite disappointed with the service. Food seemed to take a while to arrive. Then no one came to take our plates - we had to ask for a dessert menu. We observed several people queueing to get in, whilst the place was only half full, and staff just walked past them, almost like it wasn't their job to find them a table (of which there were several). It seemed like they avoided eye contact on more than one occasion when trying to get their attention. A shame as the food was lovely.",,
We have came here since 2014 on our annual holiday often visiting numerous times on our holiday .....unfortunately this year we only visited once as the device had went down hill as had the food ....I was served off seabass (I have been a chef for over 20 years so I know it was off) and my husband who always has the sizzling beef fajitas could not even chew his beef ....what a let down,,
Had dinner one night in fat mamma the food was amazing and the staff was lovely and they put on some entertainment while we where eating would defo go back if I returned to Cyprus x,,
This was our second time here as we came same time last year this time I brought 8 of my family as we thought it was very good. The meals are massive and great value. All our party said how good it was drinks are also very good value.We will be back next year hopefully bring more people over next time to stay on this lovely lsland,,
this is a great place for families the staff put on a great show of dance and singing the best in the world but entertainment the food is very good try the ribs but be hungry as there is a lot,,
We went for a meal in the hotel food was rubbish one off the best food we had all week five minutes walk from our hotel great family some great English bar near there,,
"Attended with seven members of my family. We all had starters, a main course and a couple of puddings washed down with red wine and Keo.    Four steaks, a chicken dish and burgers which were all cooked very well no complaints at all.    Entertainment was alright but nothing special. We would go again.",,
We dropped in The service was friendly but not the fastest The food was good and portions enormous Bill very reasonable Entertainment a bit cheesy but it doesn't claim to be a BAFTA contender,,
"Dropped in here for late, no booking, supper. Good food - steak and Mexican. Great table service. Good offering of local wines from decent enough winerys. And of course beer from around the world. Not sure about the “cabaret” but it was entertaining enough.",,
"We saved our visit for our last night treat. Best idea ever. We had the chicken and steak. I'm a huge steak fan and this was the best steak I have ever eaten. Beat the likes of The Champany Inn (one of the best steak houses in the world) into a distant 2nd place. Juicy, tender, tasty. I went for the small portion which was more than adequate. We then had dessert. Ice cream and chocolate fudge cake. OMG I think I went to chocolate heaven. And yes,it beat me! The entertainment was fun and part of the experience so go with it. Service was impeccable. Attentive, relaxed and friendly. Just unfortunate I can only give 5 starts. Thanks to all for a great night and total respect to the chef for a wonderful feast.",,
"we visited here the first night of our holiday. very good menu, big portions and good prices was buy one get one free on bottles of carlsberg. staff friendly and fast service would visit again",,
been coming here for years and it never disappoints.    steaks are the best.    try the sharing platter for starters little bit of everything.    fun entertainment from the dancers.    good place if you're celebrating something special.    don't come here for a quiet meal.    friendly staff who work very hard.    will be back again next time we are in paphos.,,
Came here for dinner during our holiday. Lovely open restaurant service was quick and polite. Husband had a huge steak he said was amazing no gristle and like cutting thru butter! I had the chicken caesar salad it was big and really tasty. The cabaret was good and added a great atmosphere! Not bad prices as you get great portions. Will def go back!,,
"This place is amazing!!! The fillet steak was to die for, portion size is MASSIVE! My partner had a seafood pizza and it was awesome! Highly recommend fat mamas to anyone in paphos!!",,
"Family of 4 visited with a 2 YO, greeted by an English waiter who didn't show much enthusiasm for working on a Friday night. All other staff were friendly and attentive. Plenty to chose from on an extensive menu, possible too much choice although all food I saw coming from the kitchen looked good. Portion sizes would suit even the Americans but it was all well cooked and they were good with a child's menu. Entertainment started around 7pm and although it was dated and slightly cheesy, it was enjoyable and the children especially loved it. Puts me in mind of the mini discos in Spanish hotels in the 90s.  My only real disappointment cake when we sent our compliments to the chefs and the waiter (Mr Would rather be somewhere else) rolled his eyes and walked over to the kitchen mumbling something and from the kitchen we heard a faint ""Thank you"". This used to be an energetic thank you coming all throughout the evening and was a talking point. It was unique and shouldn't be dismissed when trying to stand out in a busy Paphos. Xx",,
"Very filling menu Steak n Ribs - be very aware not to have a starter unless you plan to stay till late!  The staff do little music scenarios and if you let them know its a birthday, anniversary etc  they do a little performance and a dessert cake as a treat. Always busy best book.  You'll never leave this restraunt hungry, my daughter always goes to Fat Mamas - completes her holiday.",,
Really friendly family restaurant with quite an extensive menu. Shared platters to steaks burgers etc. You wont leave here hungary or dissapointed. Very family friendly place to eat.,,
"Since I started writing reviews I knew I had to do one for this place eventually. Every time I visit Paphos I feel the urge to have again one of my favorite eating experiences which is eating at Fat Mamas .  It might not be granted with a Michelin star ,might not even be the best food around but I ll tell you why is worth the visit during your summer holidays (that's when I always go there) It has not one but two different menus to chose from ,one with Tex-mex cousine and one more Italian style. That means you can chose from a variety of big burgers to pizzas and pastas and Mexican dishes or steaks . The prices are logical and the portions are big,some plates I dare say even huge .And all the above with the company of a show,yeah that's right the staff will dance and sing for you from retro to the new hit songs. .It kind of reminds me of ""Fridays"" restaurants in lots of ways (even the welcoming and friendly staff ) only ..with a show .You will see why its one of the first choises among tourists (and not just ) and why is always crouded (most times we had to wait in line to get a table but ok didn't take really that long )  So if you want a different experience and a good values for money place try it out",,
We both enjoyed our meals. The dancers were an added bonus. Cocktails were of poor standard. Steaks were excellent.,,
"Good food, ok service but the portions were too big - not somewhere to go for a light snack, and the dancers were a bit irritating",,
"Tried numerous meals all delicious. Don't forget the ribs. If you go large, beware, it feeds two ravenous adults, you won't need a side dish. Prices are good. You won't be disappointed.",,
We have eaten here several times over the past few years. It always had a good atmosphere and great food. This year was a different experience. 2 out of 5 of ours meals had to be sent back. One tasted awful and the chicken was very tough and the other was a sloppy pizza that looks like it had been thrown around a few times. The waiters were clearing the table before some of us had even finished eating and it was clear they were trying to get us in and out as quickly as possible. Not ideal when your on holiday and want to slow things down and have a relaxing meal. We won't be back after this experience which is a shame as my children loved the singing and dancing which helped kept them amused for our whole meal.,,
"Fat mamas is a bustling, lively place to eat, every now and then the staff will get dressed up and sing songs to you, especially if you are celebrating something. The food is excellent but be warned the portions are HUGE!!!!!",,
I f you have children go to fat mamas they will be entertained all night and great steaks for mum and dad,,
"We visited Fat Mama's on tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointing.    The food was excellent and portion sizes were huge. The ribs were particularly good.    The entertainment is just a bit of fun, however I could see why some small children were a bit scared of the characters.    All in all though, excellent value for money,",,
What an absolutely fantastic place food and a service was great also the entertainment was absolutely fantastic just need to remember the portions are massive,,
"We went here on the first night of our holiday. The atmosphere was great and the staff are lovely. Food was a real let down. I had lasagna that tasted like it was definately microwaved or just heated up. Some parts were mild warm which wasn't very nice. My partner had a pizza that he said was very low quality, we expected more for the price and the restaurant looks so appealing from the outside.",,
"Super friendly restaurant, food and service were excellent, these guys no what there doing we were a group of 8 and all of us enjoyed it , left with very full bellies, excellent value for money",,
Lovely restaurant with friendly staff. Our waitress helped us with portion size. They do small or a mamas portion. The waitress said the small was quite big and she was right. My husband ordered a desert which he didn't like so they didn't charge us for. Which i thought was very good service,,
"After coming to paphos for 11 years, I'm always so excited to go to fat mamas the food is lovely never a complaint and also the added bonus of the entertainment to keep the toddler entertained whilst we eat!    Tried somewhere different in Europe to holiday last year and no restaurants were a patch on fat mamas!",,
"Visited the restaurant with my partner last night after reading positive reviews.  It was fairly quiet when we arrived so we were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken.  The waiter advised us that the portions were large and he wasn't joking! We ordered nachos and garlic bread cheese to start and unfortunately had to leave some because there was so much.  I must say the nachos were absolutely beautiful, I could have eaten them all as a main!  We shared a pizza for our main which was lovely, however, our side of onion rings was disappointing as we were expecting home made but they were frozen ones.  Once we had eaten we requested our bill but by this time the restaurant had filled up and was much busier. After 10 minutes the bill had not been brought over so we asked another member of staff. It took a further 10-15 minutes and another reminder from us before we received it.    Overall it was a lovely meal but I've rated it 4* as the service towards the end let it down.",,
A brilliant evening was had at fat Mamas. The food was excellent and the portions huge. The entertainment during the evening is light hearted and fun adding another dimension to an evening out.  The entertainers made a fuss of the members of our party who had birthdays and provided bubbly for the couple who had come to Cyprus to get married two days before. This was a real nice touch.,,
Fat Mamas meal that is enormous in size or standard size meal that I found was more than big enough for me. Will supply doggy bags if asked for. Food is excellent and gives a really big choice of different types of food,,
Visited here once while in paphos I had the small portion of spare ribs which were lovely but they were huge there was enough for two the service was very good make sure to get there early as you will have to wait for a table as it gets that busy,,
Really good food and great atmosphere there made to feel extra special. Huge selection of food a must visit,,
"We were recommended here by a friend so came to see if we thought it was good too Service was good , friendly staff and good food Entertainment was a bonus and made the night more fun Would visit again",,
"Food was fine, service was good. The restaurant was spotlessly clean and was quite busy. The one thing that spoilt it for us, was the dreadful entertainment that the staff do. It was pretty embarrassing. Made no sense at all and just made people look away. Would have enjoyed it more if there was just some local musician on..",,
Ate here twice during our holiday in Paphos. We ate once with the beer on buy one get one free 17:00 to 18:00. The second time with cocktails buy one get one free between 18:00 and 19:00. Booking was recommended between 17:00 and 19:00. We booked a table on our first visit but just walked in the second time. With the exception of a rather bland spaghetti bolognese on our first visit all of the other dishes were tasty and large portion sizes. Would recommend Fat Mama to others visiting this part of Paphos,,
"Everyone said what a great restaurant so was a bit disappointed, with ribs although big portions, sauce wasn't great, also told them was a celebration birthday when they asked if we were celebrating , the next table got champagne an a fuss, but we didn't hear anymore , left disappointed , also was two mins late for the buy one get one free cocktails !,,,,",,
Went here on two occasions with my family service was exceptional food was absolutely amazing couldn't do enough we were in Cyprus as my son got married when Alex the owner overheard he sent girls over with two glasses of champagne for my son and wife with warm wishes and also offered us a round of drinks how nice dessert was out of this world so tasty we enjoyed it so much we went on our last night and as before service and food was every bit as wonderful as the last time it's a must if your staying in paphos well done to you all,,
"Fillet steak with pepper sauce! absolutely delicious so much so on our last night we went back again and i had the same and it did not disappoint.  Service was good considering how busy it was both times we went and we all enjoyed our meals.  Not sure about the dancers personally,i was more than happy as things where before they came out both times with the staff clapping and whooping but im sure the show was enjoyed by others,i was busy trying to eat my lovely steak.  I would definitely go back again.",,
"Went for tea at Fat Mammas last week and can't say I would recommend. The service was a bit slow, however it was fairly busy so we didn't mind that so much and we got off to a good start with some nachos to share, they were loaded with chilli and the usual accompaniments (guacamole, sour cream, salsa, cheese) and were very tasty. The menu is expansive and I mean, if you can think of it, they probably do it (which isn't always a good thing). For main course I ordered spaghetti carbonara, which was really over cooked so it was sloppy and INCREDIBLY bland, there was definitely no seasoning in it whatsoever and the 'bacon' was more like small chunks of Pek. My boyfriend had the ribs, which came recommended by the waitress, to be fair the meat was tender and came off the bone nicely, however it was again very bland and the sauce was more akin to weak Bisto than a genuine BBQ rib style.    Fat Mammas has a reputation for generous portion sizes, which is true, but quality overrides quantity in my opinion and I would have rather had a smaller portion of good food that tastes nice, than a massive portion of food that isn't great.    Unbeknown to us there is also a cabaret act, which consists of two dancers flailing around at breakneck speeds, for me it didn't really add to the experience.    I'd say more focus to providing food that tastes good should be the priority over offering such a massive variety on the menu, large portions or cabaret acts.",,
Best spare ribs ever tasted fast and friendly service entertainment was good prices very reasonable especially for the quality and portion sizes,,
Well if you like being harassed to pick something and then waiter just picking my Bottle saying you're finish and walking off !! It wasn't.  Then a waiter coming over when my wife still had 3 pizza slices on the plate saying you're finish we said no and then 5 mins later another saying the same !!!  Ruined the evening.  Quick to take money but had to ask for change.  Feel as if the staff wanted to finish and go home.  But for this food good and there was entertainment with fat mama & Willys in costumes coming out.  Great for announcements which we had a few in the short time there.,,
"Had a great night here after being recommended to us, was busy, the staff where very attentive my husband loved the cowboys ribs, they have entertainment which made it fun & lively and moderately priced",,
Best varied menu we have seen in all restaurants we visited in paphos. Quick pleasant service. If you like a American style dinner this is the place for you! The lady dancers are not bad to! My no1 in paphos.....,,
"My family and I went here for evening dinner. I ordered small portion of ribs. Others had burgers. I would hate to think how big the large portion would have been! my bbq ribs filled the plate!, and I struggled to finish the meal, having to leave the chips. The burgers were also huge. There were singers and dancers throughout our meal. Not sure what all that was about, but it was different. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Drinks were average price. If you are hungry go here. It was very poular and folk were cuing to get in.",,
Great food and loads of it. Ribs are the best. Entertainment ok. Keeps everyone happy. Book early as very busy.,,
Booked in a group of 12 and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The food and drink are reasonably priced and the portions large enough for the heartiest appetite.  The cabaret was entertaining enough although not my favourite distraction.  I will definitely visit the next time that I am in Paphos.,,
"Substatial `American` portions, fast service by friendly staff, great atmosphere with some entertainment. Huge rack of ribs are a must.",,
"My usual vist to fat mama's, a large rack of ribs with side order of chips, not bad and large enough for the local cats at my apartments to get some, a show is put on by the girls high kicks ect, all in the price, different.  They say you can tell when paphos is busy by the length of time it takes to get let in, i waited 10 minutes,  Worth the wait.",,
"Only want there to get some carbs down me before our 5 hour flight, boringly average chain food. Reasonably cooked steak....and chips [ you can always get chips ]",,
Probably one of the best meals we had. Great service and fresh food served to a high standard. Always busy,,
"Went to Fat Mama's as suggested by severeral people, must say was not disappointed the food was excellent, the ribs are the best I have ever had and the portions were massive (had to take some home in doggy bag) the burgers and fajitias were also delicious. Staff were really friendly and the entertainment (cabaret) was brilliant. Would definitely visit again when we return to Paphos.",,
Omg. Best meal I've had. And entertainment. Service is exemplary. Menu is extensive. Seating inside and out and free WiFi,,
Share starters and mains as very big portions unless you're starving! Lovely food Service great and lovely atmosphere,,
"So where do I start..    Me and the girlfriend came here one night as we passed a few times and could see how busy the place gets and how nicely presented it looked.. so we thought we'd give it a shot!    We got welcomed by a nice member of staff, and were seated and looked after throughout the whole time we were there. Great staff and great service.    The menu... there is more then enough options to choose from, there's something for everyone.. getting 2 menu's is such a great idea and means no ones going hungry!    The food doesn't take long and when it comes its.... AMAZING! Would highly recommend! Me and the girlfriend have been here twice in one week and both times have been overly impressed and will be returning before we go home.    The entertainment is spot on, with fat mama and cowboy willy coming out in costumes for the kids and then the dancers/singers for everyone else.. it's such a wonderful atmosphere and a lively night whilst enjoying some top quality food.    The one thing I would recommend is booking a table because by 19:00 it's starting to queue down to the road! But am I surprised? No? The food is amazing and the entertainment is great. So the place is always busy and always full. Monday night and there's people queuing down the road. Clearly tells you a lot!    To sum it up.. if your in paphos its more then definitely worth your time to stop off and enjoy a nice meal and some great entertainment :)",,
Always busy. Food is good but not everyone's cup of tea. Cheesy entertainment. The queues every night tend to put people off coming.,,
"Me and my husband had our 2nd wedding anniversary meal here and my oh my did it not disappoint! The food was all amazing and very large portions, we ended up having to take it away because we couldn't finish it but ate some of it back at the hotel as it was amazing.    There were dancers performing throughout the night which we found fun even though it could be considered a little cheesy, it worked for us! They were also giving shout outs to anyone celebrating that night (which included us!) which was fun and we got some free champagne!    I ordered the mussels and the chilli and my husband had chicken wings and steak fajitas (photos attached) there was a good variety of food to choose from and I was disappointed that I was too full for dessert as I really wanted the chocolate fudge cake!    There is a huge selection of drinks to choose from too. Overall we had a very fun night, food, drink, entertainment and just a great time! We will definitely be coming back!",,
"It was nice place to eat starter was excellent I had filled mushrooms and my husband had prawns on toast.  My husband said his main steak Diana was excellent, I chose the pasta but was not to my liking I found did not really have much flavour but that was just me.  Would eat there again but would have something different.",,
"We visited here once for dinner. The food was good but there are other places nearby that we would recommend more. My girlfriend's spaghetti Bolognese was very over cooked with soggy spaghetti. However the ribs I had were good if not amazing. The portions are very large though, I went for the normal size instead of the larger 'fat mama's' size ribs and still couldn't finish it all.",,
"Ate here on the first day of our holiday. Food and cocktails were nice enough but throughout dinner there were dancers right behind me and at one point, me and my food were nearly knocked into by the entertainment. Very loud music to accompany as well:",,
"Came here for a meal durian my recent holiday, had a nice pizza, the shows/dancing weren't to my liking but that's just personal taste, others will like that aspect, especially kids. Overall ""pretty good""",,
We were guests at my sssister in laws 60th Birthday here. Had to book otherwise queue for a table. Nic friendly welcome and waitress could not do enough for us. Food menu had a ot of choice and looking around at other tables - large portions I ordered chicken which when it arrived I knew I wouldnt finish. My husband had spare ribs and could have eaten more. Half way through the meal music began and the waitresses ha dressed up to entertain us. Photos were taken with them. And we had a lot of fun. It wasnt my kind of place but everyone seemed to have a good time may return one day.,,
"Went here twice on a recent holiday to Coral Bay and enjoyed the food both times, the wait to be seated and for food can be a bit slow but it's always busy so that's a good sign",,
"Really enjoyed our meal at this restaurant , food excellent staff friendly , entertainment from the staff added to the atmosphere , all I can say is there was not enough!",,
You cant go to Paphos and not go to Fat Mama's. One if not the best restaurant around. Not only is the food and cocktails lovely but the entertainment is definitely a plus.,,
"There was plenty to choose from on both menus, the food was absolutely delicious. There was a party of 7 of us celebrating a birthday which the girls brought a cocktail over and sang happy birthday. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment.",,
Myself and my husband visited fat mama's twice during our holiday. Both times we loved the food. In particular I'd recommend the nachos and the steaks! Big portions for very reasonable prices.,,
"I didn't like the food here, my husband said his was ok, I think most people went for the entertainment , 3 young ladies dancing, but you could here the music all the way down the street, and there was always a que",,
"At Fat Mama's the vegetarin menu looked quite good. We ordered vegetarian potato skins and vegetarian nachos.  When they arrived the skins were filled with meat and the nachos may have been, too.  On pointing this out to a 'server' they were replaced but, and it is a big but, the food was terrible.  I do not know where they source their nachos but they were not anything like nachos I have eaten in both other parts of Europe and the USA. The cheese was cold in parts and in spite of the fact thst the plate was hot, the middle of the dish was cold. Additionally the 'nachos' on the outer part of the plate were burnt.  With regard to the potato skins they too were slightly burnt.  We will not be returning to Fat Mama's .",,
"Wow what an amazing evening had by all our party of 7 for one of our birthdays. Was a bit worried reading online that no reservations were taken and you had to go and queue, but there was no reason to worry we waited no more than 5 mins for a table. When we were seated we advised the waiter of a birthday and drinks were soon brought over. For mains a majority of us had steaks, and I have to say these were by far the best we had all ever had! Cooked to perfection! We opted for the smaller portion which was plenty big enough (i dread to think how big the large portion is). The dancers came over, and did a little dance and a happy birthday song to which was a fantastic touch with the birthday hat and a cheeky cocktail (there must have been about 8 birthdays that night) but it was nice of the waiter to tell them. A few of us had puddings and after a slight mix up of being brought coke over cake (which we have to laugh about) have to say the best fudge cake ever and it was HUGE!! There was a little show put on that was OK nothing spectacular but was good to watch, but overalls wouldn't hesitate to go back here for food and would highly recommend it. (Also a huge thanks to the English lady who went out her way to get me a number of a dentist - didn't quite get her name but she is an asset to the restaurant)",,
"Its a family tradition to eat here when we visit paphos. Love this place. Food is great, portions are massive, prices are reasonable. Staff are friendly, its a busy busy place. they have show girl who put on a few dances througoput the night and will make a fuss if you have a bday or celebration... Love it",,
"This is a very lovely restaurant! The food was amazing and cooked lovely, there's a choice of small and large portions, but a small portion is big and i still couldn't finish it and large portion is just massive too much to eat! It's definatley worth every penny! There were dancers as entertainment when we were there aswell which was a nice touch.",,
The food here is delicious (we ate steak and seafood pasta) and the service is great. It is expensive but the portions are HUGE so it is good value. We ate here on a recommendation but personally it felt like we could be anywhere in the world. The atmosphere is great (we were also there the same night as the hen do) and it was a fun night (good cocktails!) but I would have preferred if there had been some local dishes on the menu. The dancers are a fun but the singer was awful!!,,
"Me and my girlfriend went and the food was really nice, but I didn't like the entertainment, it was too loud and close to everything whilst we're eating",,
"Due to the food being dreadful in our hotel myself my wife and my 18month old daughter went here. It's 10+ years since we were there and it's just as good now, if not better, than it was then. Highly recommended.",,
"Went for dinner here and as everyone else has said, yes - the portions are huge!    The staff are friendly and there's a real, fun vibe about the place. Imagine going to a TGI Fridays in a holiday resort and you're not far wrong, just a little less on the quality side. But even though, don't let this put you off as it's still worth a visit.",,
"A brilliant night out for anyone visiting Paphos. A really comprehensive menu from Italian to American ribs (and you can mix & match also). Over the years visiting Cyprus, we have been to this restaurant many times and every visit has been enjoyable. The young waiters & waittresses are a lively brilliant lot (even doing a spot of cabaret during dinner service!) well trained, and always pleasant and wanting to give good service. Food is excellent and portions enormous! The only slight drawback is that you can't book and therefore during very busy periods you have to queue to get in. However, they work the table very efficiently (without rushing you) and there is lots of room, so waiting time isn't usually longer than half an hour--and well worth the wait!",,
12 of us came to eat here on my 3rd hen do (two in the U.K. Before that haha) and it was really busy but the staff there told us to wait five mins and they rustled up a lovely big table for us - upon discovering it was my hen do - the staff there got us involved up dancing and made us feel very special and we were given a small bottle of champagne - the food was plentiful and very delicious - loved my visit there and will definitely attend again ! X,,
"We got told to try fat mama's by a friend and I must say we are very glad we did, the atmosphere and food are first class and the service is exceptional, we had a hen party in the night we went but that for me just added to the night.  I will definitely revisit again and again.",,
Lots of show but underneath a fairly standard restaurant. Portions are big and served in decent time but nothing really any better than anywhere else. Ate on the TOKR a few times and there are other places that do better food at cheaper price without the gimmicks.  I will say it is good for kids for.,,
"Fantastic restaurant, food could not be faulted and very reasonable. One of he children had a birthday, they staff sang happy birthday and gave him a drink.",,
This is a fun place that's always busy but we felt a little let down with the quality of the food. Nowhere near to the standard of a TGI which menu is very similar.,,
Excellent steaks better than most high end steak restaurants in Britain. Definite must visit if your staying in paphos. Very reasonably priced aswell,,
Always have good entertainment for all of the family. Food is not bad and can be a bit expensive. Still worth a visit,,
"ok food, ok restaurant, have all types of dishes, family oriented, not too much to enjoy, basic Pizza and Burgers",,
Just microwaved tastless rubbish chucked out at rediculous prices..sorry not good.trying to think of something positive to write but nothing happening.,,
Fun filled diner with enthusiastic staff. The portions are huge & the peppered steak was delicious. The desserts are the sameIt was good value for money. The staff are very attentive. Would definitely recommend.,,
"I've been coming here for 7 years. The food is actually decent. Don't expect Michelin 5 star but as American/Italian goes it's not bad. The smaller portions are actually very generous.    For me this place isn't about the food, it's the entertainment. My kids love it, I enjoy it too. We were lucky enough on Thursday to see Stavros Flatley. This really did make the night, he was brilliant.    The portions are massive, we had a garlic bread to share which came with about 6 large pieces. I had the prawn cocktail which was nice. My wife had carbonara and shared it with our 6 year old (even the small portion is very big and excellent value too) I went for the mama sized ribs.    My advice is go for the small portions and you will feel like you've had good value. I find if we have the mama portions, we don't eat it all and it really inflates the bill leaving a feeling of the place being expensive.    My only complaints are that the queue is manufactured, if you go early the queue is quite big vs number of empty tables. I'd like to be seated quickly when I get there. Also, having been coming here for 7 years some of the staff being the same l, we've never been recognised as returning customers and are always asked have you been here before. I appreciate its busy and lots of faces to remember but that would be a nice touch for us.    Overall this is a great night out with good food and fantastic entertainment. Will visit again a couple of times next year.",,
"I have spent a fortnight in Paphos recently.    I like total a range of restaurants wherever I go. With that objective I ent with family to Fat Mama's.    The dancing girls were not excellent. Only half a song per routine. Only one could sing, another ""murdered"" happy birthday repeatedly.    The range of food was excellent. However, I found the size of servings to be ridiculous.    I selected the 9 inch meat pizza. It was excellent. In all fairness it was the best pizza I have had for a while, regardless of the country I was in at the time.    My family had other items from the menu. They do a barbecue sauce. It is not good !    My partner tried the pasta a few days later. She had a Bolognese sauce on spaghetti. The pasta was swimming in water. It was as if they did not bother to drain the pasta.    Need I say more ?    That said I heard several people saying that quantity was excellent so they were happy.    I won't be returning.",,
"Wonderful food. Great service offered by Megan ..... full of smiles, chat & helpful with Menu. A must if you visit the area. 👍",,
Lovely amazing food reasonable price . After 6 o'clock always a que which is a good sign . Me and my husband went for it opening at 5 no que . Staff very friendly also very clean place .only downfall is we left it till very end of hols and couldn't try again thanks to all the staff,,
"Just came back from 2 weeks in Paphos and we visited Fat Mama's on a couple of occasions. We couldn't make a reservation but had no issue being seated, and never had to wait. Food was lovely and as everyone has mentioned... big portions! Really lovely staff, very attentitive and friendly. Didn't have to wait too long for food either, despite how busy it was. We still couldn't resist trying a desert on our 2nd visit though, safe to say we were in a food coma for the rest of the night!    The only downside was the entertainment, I'm not the biggest fan of cabaret and it did cheapen the place in my opinion. On our first visit we were asked if it was anyone's birthday, it wasn't but we still had happy birthday sang to one of my friends and a free cocktail. Which although was funny, it did get a bit repepatitive after hearing it sang to 3 other tables, as well as a wedding anniversary!    Would have loved to have been there when Stavros Flatley were performing though.    I would still highly recommend, makes a nice change from the more 'traditional' restaurants on the harbour.",,
What can I say great food great service with a smile with a bit of entertainment this place gets busy give it a try you won't be disappointed,,
"We try Fat Mama's we never leave disappointed, great entertainment and food is always lovely !Good lack",,
"I took my family here after reading the reviews, but out of all the wonderful restaurants of Paphos this is not worth it for the food.  If you are up for a good laugh and some fun entertainment with great dancers then this is the place for you.  The food is very cheap but rightly so! Don't go if you are a foodie as you will be disappointed!",,
"Friendly staff, good food, very clean, kids also enjoyed it very much. Will definitely visit this place again!",,
"This restaurant is a must for those visiting Paphos, not only a great restaurant with good quality, reasonable priced food, large portions as standard, but singing and dance acts perform whilst you are eating. A unique and memorable night out, with an atmosphere second to none. A British lady owns the restaurant and is a great host who also sings, fantastic. Even if All Inclusive I would recommend that you venture out for this one",,
"Massive portions, varied selection, speedy efficient service, tasty food, family friendly, always busy (and rightly so), entertainment on during meal, massive portions, enthusiastic staff, excellent value. Did I mention the portion sizes are massive?",,
"Every time we try Fat Mama's we never leave disappointed, great entertainment and food is always lovely !",,
"The food here is pretty standard, good food. The crowds are drawn here by the entertainment, which is what you want when you are on a holiday. Fat mamas knows what tourists want.",,
Visited recently with my wife and daughter and must say wasn't disappointed! Food was lovely but listen to the advice of the staff portion sizes are massive! Ribs were definitely the best I've had in a while and highly recommend the nachos! Must visit if you are in the area!,,
Really quick service with entertainment. Don't expect a quiet evening there! Food was fantastic with very large portions all reasonably priced. Well worth a visit but you need to book.,,
"We were searching for a place to eat for dinner in the heart of Paphos. It was definately an awesome atmosphere and entertaining night, however the food needs some improvements to be excellent!",,
"We arrived at Fat Mama's on the evening of my brothers birthday.  Not only was the food amazing and the portion sizes huge, the entertainment was out of this world. My brother really enjoyed getting happy birthday sang to him by the beautiful waitresses/ dancers.  One of the best meals of our holidays.",,
Had another wonderful evening with fabulous food and entertainment. Always manages to find us a table even though incredibly busy. Must try the fillet steak.Cooked to perfection and so tasty. Thank you all the staff you are doing a great job.,,
"Ok .... nothing bad really to say but people really bigged this place up and like I say although nothing really bad to say about it it didn't live up to the hype really for us , food was ok , drinks ok , service ok ..... it's a bit full on kind of like a cabaret club come restaurant so if your wanting a quiet meal maybe not the place for you",,
"Ate here last night stood in line for about 10 minutes to be seated as the place was really busy. When we sat down service was prompt and personable. The food we had was great although to much of it. We were there for occasional entertainment and the full cabaret act which was cheesy but really good, all the young kids in the place loved. All in all we had a really good time and experience. To top it all off we finished with the HUGE chocolate fudge cake and it did not disappoint. Great place al round",,
Meals are excellent been a few times can be very busy can be nosy some times but all good fun staff are great,,
"Just had a great meal at Fat mamas, food was amazing and very large portions, even the kids meal was large !! Dancing girls were great added a bit of entertainment to eating dinner.  Pudding was amazing, however myself and my son shared the pancakes and we could not even finish it !!!  Had a really good experience, and the cost of the meal was reasonable.  Only down side was that when the bill came it was highlighted for €58, as it said there was a 10% discount..,, this was not the case, we were charged €64 for paying by card ... when we questioned the cost we were told the €58 was for cash ..... this should have been pointed out before we ate or had it written on the receipt as it is very misleading and we thought we had gotten a discount, shame as we are only day 2 into our holiday, !!!!.",,
8 of us arrived at 7 for dinner and managed to get a table as the restaurant was beginning to fill up rapidly.Food was great and all the staff were friendly and efficient.,,
Fab place!! Entertainment and huge (too big!! 😂) portions. Lovely food great atmosphere. Booking ahead is recommended,,
Visited with our two young kids. Wide range of food choice available, both Italian and American. Staff were friendly and food was very tasty. Food served very quickly and the staff are extremely attentive in clearing the table (we lost some straws we'd brought along for the kids because their empty glasses were whisked away before we'd realised!)    Live entertainment is well choreographed and brings further fun to the experience. There are also some arcade-style games in the corner for the kids to occupy themselves with whilst waiting.,
A place more for families. Food not really that good but entertainment fun. Mains are far too big and lacking flavour and presentation. Starters however were pleasant.,,
"Great food, friendly staff and fab entertainment, we always have a great night at Fat Mama's when we visit.",,
"I visited Fat Mamas last week with my Family... all I can say is AMAZING  From the food to the staff I couldn't mention a bad word.    We arrived at around 7:30 and although a short queue we were sat as soon as they were able to find us a table and my oh my aren't we glad we waited!!! Whilst we waited to see what the fuss was about we were entertained by a young lady and two mascots which we later discovered to be the ""owners"" of the restaurant Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy!!    After we ordered our food and it had arrived (which I must say they don't shy on the portion sizes) we sat and watched the 3 wonderful dancers work hard in the crazy heat to put on a show for the customers, it truly was fantastic and they are all such lovely girls (don't forget to mention if you have a special occasion)    Overall the whole evening was wild and wonderful and the staff were so attentive and full of spirit especially DJ and Cathy to say a couple of names!!    Thank you for the amazing experience if I am ever back in Paphos I will be banging down fat Mamas door (if you had one ;))    P.s I recommend the Ribs!!!!!",,
"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE AND UNACCEPTABLE ATTITUDE.  They treat customers with arrogance.  They never honored the reservation, offered no solution but to separate the group of friends, even leave 3 unseated,and even kicked the group out, when they tried to ask for an explanation and on top of that they even insulted them.  Please disregard this place as a place with Cyprus hospitality.",,
"Great place to eat, the food is excellent with massive portions. The entertainment is really good for families and our children love to go.  It's good value for money and the service is quick and professional. Great evening had by the 8 of us that visited this week.",,
There is no doubt about it - this restaurant have got it soooo right! Generous portion sizes combined with exceptional value for money mean that customers return again and again! The ribs are out of this world and for those with a bigger than normal appetite you can choose between a regular or large portion size. Entertainment is in the form of girls singing and dancing so don't visit if you want a quiet romantic meal - it won't happen! The kids loved it though and even soft drinks were reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in the area. Highly recommended. The only downside is that the toilets are located downstairs which isn't ideal for customers with disabilities.,,
Very polite and friendly staff. the food came very early and the restaurant was full. there was a queue outside. the show with the girls was excellent. sure i will visit it again.,,
"Visited here twice during our 2 week stay. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. The entertainment is really enjoyable, the kids loved it. There's often a queue outside but they do get you seated quite quickly. Worth booking a table in advance if there are a few of you.",,
We have been visiting Fat Mama's for 16 years on our yearly holiday to Paphos. The quality of food is always of a consistent high standard with a fantastic team always eager to please. The staff have always been super friendly and fantastic with my children who love this establishment. Highly recommend Fat Mama's.,,
"The food at fat mama's was good although not exceptional, the menu is all american. mexican food so not one to go to if you are looking for a traditional greek meal. That said the service was good, the drinks menu was great, the portions were large and the entertainment was fantastic. The dancers cabaret show had us in fits of giggles and we had great fun deciding what number might come on next.",,
"C'mon guys you all start with ""went here last night...... took my husband .... found this place.....""  Where's your originality .....my wife found this place two nights ago..... we went....    And it was great it's like you are at someone else's party but they are pleased you turned up, everyone is happy, everything is fun, from the dancers to the huge healthy portions. It's all reasonably priced, cocktails are tasty and staff are great    If it's too hot for you, if you just haven't calmed down yet, if you just want a quiet night, walk on by because your holiday good mood is inside and unless you're up for it you can eat somewhere else please    We're all having fun..,,,    Thank you for a lovely lively evening we won't be back it would only spoil the memories but they're all good ones",,
Couldn't have picked a better restaurant. Great service and the food was on point. The entertainment was fabulous. And the waiter/waitresses couldn't of been more helpful. I would recommend to people who want the perfect evening.,,
"Most popular restaurant in town. Lots of choice , large portions, very busy, side entertainment. Slightly expensive but good value must book early.",,
"While we had a reservation for specific time, they didn't accept us and told us to wait in the queue that was huge. After we expressed our disappointment, the staff told us to leave the restaurant in the rudest way!!! Definitely not recommended!!!",,
"I made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for 15, at 9:30 for tonight. We went there around 9. At first they said they were expecting us at 8 and because we did not show up they gave it elsewhere. Then they wanted to put 12 of us in 2 separate tables. Then, they said that it's been 25 years that their policy is to not make reservations for after 7pm and to give the next available table and that they should have known it (I've never been to Pafos so OBVIOUSLY I did not know about this). Then, when we challenged them, they kicked us out. Of course we won't be caught dead eating there - they are useless, unprofessional, rude and arrogant. They've lost waaaay more than 15 people and it's no wonder locals have never been.",,
"Super family-type restaurant with a varied menu. Attentive staff, some of whom carry out mini cabernet spots.  The only negative, and it's not a ""fault"" on their part - the portions are HUGE. The waitress stressed this as we ordered, mentioning it to the ladies, but still when the 'small' portions arrived they would have served a hungry man.  Overall though, great food, attentive service, TV if you wanted it, and reasonably priced.",,
"Was recommended to visit Fat mamas whilst chatting in the pool , good food , great entertainment from the dancers very nice atmosphere and me and family loved it was good night out !!!",,
"Thought we would give fat mama's ago as always a queue when we walked past, and wondered what all the fuss was about? Was a little queue to get in as we didn't reserve a table, but we were seated within 5 minutes as only 2 of us, I would recommend to reserve if a large party. On placing our order the waitress advised us the portions were large and if starters were required to share them. Ordered the chilli con carne and true to their word the portions were huge. Food was very tasty, and garlic bread was amazing!! Always something going on every 15/25 minutes to keep you and the kids entertained but nothing to put you off your meal if anything thing made the evening a whole lot more enjoyable, wasn't rushed to leave even tho a large queue was forming outside",,
Very large portions and at good prices. I recommend the barbeque ribs. They are particularly good. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the dancers are amazing.,,
"Booked fat mamas as was told it is very busy  On arrival we had to wait in the queue to be seated  We were given 2 different menues and told to order from either menu  We had a shared platter of nachos 2 potato skins some mushrooms and bruscetta which was ok  BUT IT WAS ALL DOWN HILL FROM THERE!!!  My son ordered a chicken fajitas which only came with 3 very small wraps. The filling of chicken and peppers was tasteless SO THAT WASNT EATEN  My wife ordered penne pasta  How can you get that wrong  On arrival looked ok but the taste was horrible. It tasted like they had poured a very sweet syrup over the tomato sauce , disgusting SO THAT WASNT EATEN  My daughter an I shared a pizza which we made ourselves  This I feel is the wize move  Dancers put on a small show and then 2 mascots one was fat mamma the other was cowboy Willy  That was ok  Then they try a hard sell on merchandise like t-shirts for you to buy  The final straw was a questionnaire which asks which restaurants you have been local to them.  In my opinion there are much better places to eat in PAPHOS",,
"If you go make sure you book or else you will be queuing down the street. The food, drinks and service was outstanding. Be warned the portions are massive. They have a couple of menus to choose from and are spot on if you are gluten free. Nothing bad to say at all. We fell in love with Paphos and will come again.",,
A great American/Italian restaurant. Massive portions so make sure you are hungry. Good atmosphere with dancers for entertainment.,,
"We have lived in Paphos for nine years and never been to Fat Mamma's,my family came over to visit my wife and i and invited us along. we had a great time we found it friendly food was plentiful and service was friendly. I enjoyed the entertainment with dancers and a very good singer i believe her name was Kate? we visited on a Tuesday night it was busy i think if it you go on a weekend you would probably need to book.  A great night out.",,
"I was recommended to this place so I booked a table, went there and wow the meals are superb and tasty staff are very friendly.Go and expierence it for yourself...",,
"You wont need a starter. Ribs are a must. Burgers amazing too. Great friendly staff, couldn't be more attentive. Entertainment mini show every 20 or 30 mins. Get in before 7 for 10% discount. Kids liked fat mama and cowboy willy coming out.",,
"We decided to eat at fat mamas as we had been having Cypriot food all week and wanted a change. It happened to be my friends birthday the night we ate here which we mentioned as we sat down, they brought him a surprise cocktail free of charge and got the dancers to come sing to him. Eating here is an experience, every 10 minutes 3 dancers would come out in a different outfit and perform some routine and sing, all the children really enjoyed it. The food was also delicious, a bit more on the pricier side when taking into consideration other restaurants we ate at however I can not fault the service or quality. If you are after a change of food then I'd definitely recommend trying here.",,
"We have stayed in paphos on many occasions and always ensure that we visit fat mammas whilst on holiday. Food choice is excellent and the portions would feed you for a week, hence the reason I only ever order one course. Starter portions are the size of a main meal. Drinks are fabulous too, great choice of drinks and the cocktails are lush. Staff always very attentive and helpful. We visited in a group of 20 this year and were served quickly considering the larger group. Always book in advance though if going as a group as it's always very busy.",,
Food amazing there are dancers who come out every now and again service great portions are huge so be careful when ordering well worth the money,,
"Great place for American burgers, ribs, chilli etc Looks completely chaos with staff running around, girls dancing and singing but the food was lovely, staff friendly A great evening",,
"We were recommended by friends to try this place, after reading some of the reviews on TripAdviser we were looking forward to our dinner. We were sadly disappointed. We were stuck on a crap table which was very hot ( when we arrived the waiter asked if we had booked, to which I told them their web site stated that they could not take reservations after 7pm ) hence the crap table! Although the portions were huge, the food was pretty poor and boring so loads got water. Not impressed at all.",,
"Wow, what can we say we were so impressed we returned for another evening meal. There is 2 menus to choose from and the portions are huge!!! We never managed a desert  They do 2 for 1 cocktails between 6 and 7 pm,  They have 3 ladies singing and dancing during parts of the evening, they sing happy birthday to anyone celebrating which is a lovely touch.  This is a very busy restaurant and if you don't arrive early you will have to queue, well worth a visit, I would highly recommend it",,
"We went for a meal here and the food was ok, unfortunately I felt like I was in an episode of Benidorm",,
"Fantastic restaurant great entertainment for families they have the waitresses dancing which is suitable for little ones, expect to wait a while for a table as its always ram packed but worth the wait 👍",,
Saw loads queuing every night so though we'd try it. It was ok but not special the nail bar / tattoo bit was good but apart from that average,,
"Visited the restaurant and is a great night for the family. Food was a little average in taste but really large portions. As family of 7 we had 3 starters between us, a main course, 2 desserts, multiple drinks each (alcoholic and non alcoholic) and wine and the bill averaged at 30 euros per head, which I fault was really good. The staff also put on a fantastic show and were great with the kids. If you're looking for an evening of sophisticated fine dining I'd go elsewhere but for a well priced meal and a bloody good time, this is the place for you",,
"After our visit last week we couldn't wait to come back, had to move seat as a gentleman behind smoking a large cigar which the fans blew smoke direct to our table. This was no trouble however when moved our glasses were cleared and we lost our drinks. When we drew this to the attention of the waiter he explained that the table had been cleared in error. He did not offer us any other drink. We basically didn't see staff afterwards which made us feel as if we had done something wrong asking to be moved (we have 3 young daughters and they could not stand the smell nor should they). The food was delicious again but as I said disappointed on how we were treated which wasted our experience. We were brought our bill straight after our main meal and not offered a desert. This was obviously a mistake but after what we experienced we felt we were being pushed out. This was not what we expected and has caused us to question whether we will be back.",,
"Visited here 10 years ago, huge portions unfortunately that's gone now and menu is fairy bland compared to other local restaurants..service was good, some cool entertainment which was good for our little one. Seating quite cramped and food can be found in UK at commercial places. Great dining experience but unfortunately walked away thinking we had lost a night of good cuisine in Cyprus",,
10 days in Paphos and we visited this place twice (Wish we visited it another 8 times) Great service and great food. and entertainment. The only downside would be leaving the food because the portions are HUGE... I highly recommend it and would certainly return,,
"To be honest we were reccomended this place by our villa owners and to be honest its the only place we had dinner in cyprus during out two week stay that i wouldnt have gone back too , the food was bland and taistless the pizza was just ok the service was slow although it was very busy. The entertainment was bordering on the tedious, all in all their are far better places to eat in Paphos and the surrounding areas so give this a miss.",,
"Sorry but the steak wasnt that nice, considering how much it cost!.. would not visit here again.. brushetta was nice though.. nice staff..",,
"Visited this gaff on Monday 7th August, had to queue which wasn't an issue seeing as all the other reviews stated the fact. Once inside we were given our table and menus. Waited a good 10 mins for a waitress to come over and take our drink order, it was 30 plus degrees and we were in bad need of a drink. No waitress came so we flagged down one and ordered our drinks. Our food was ordered some 15 minutes after this, I plumped for the Pepper Steak. This steak comes in 2 sizes, 6oz and a so called Mamas Portion. I ordered the Mamas and waited with excitement as I was starving. The food arrived and my steak was so small I could barely see it under a pint of pepper sauce. I called the waitress over to query if this was the so called Mamas Portion, to which she replied ""I don't know I'll have to check with the kitchen "". The waitress returned with the cheesiest grin you've ever seen and said "" I'm sorry about that, you clearly know your steaks don't you"", I'll get the kitchen to do you the correct one. 10 mins later the steak arrived, I had asked for it to be done medium but once I dug my knife into it, their was more blood running out of it than a burst blood vessel, it was so under done it started mooing at me.  Overall it was a pretty bad meal. Not impressed!",,
"Myself & my wife went to Fat Mama`s for a evening meal We have been there before but this time it was Excellent fantastic food, Service was Great and food was well Priced, we even got a 10% discount on our meal for going early,  Fat Mama`s have greatly improved there service since we have been there last about 2 years ago, So all I can is keep up the good work and hope to visit next Holiday",,
"Great night out , fantastic food at low prices , even have entertainment on in evenings, such a good experience coming here",,
"After seeing large queues our party of 6 adults and 2 kids had to see what all the fuss was about...what an overpriced waste of money!! The staff were really friendly but as the night got busier we had to look for them to order drinks, our meals were not in the slightest good or cooked at all well so we left feeling very disappointed and almost €200 euros lighter!!!the 3 girls who danced managed the same dance to every song almost I even think my 5year old granddaughter could have done a better job....we definitely won't be returning!!Also parents beware of the lady doing nails and tattoos they come off within a couple of hours",,
"We went to fat mamma,s as we had heard good reports and as we hadn't gone on our last two times to Cyprus we had to this visit. Well I haven't seen that much food on plate the burgers are mega and as got the lasagna omg entertainment good and on a whole a very good night at quite a fair price",,
"Food is very bland and normal.    The atmosphere might be fun for small kids but the food is not great at all.    For us, not value for money.    You may like it though.    It's all about the show and not the quality of the food.    Cheers",,
Are here twice and had two great meals. Portion sizes very good and good variety. Entertainment every night and staff very good.,,
Soooo much choice and all cooked to perfection! Something for everyone and entertainment too. Well priced!,,
"The food was nice, lots of steak and meat options. I like the cocktails, loads of choices and very reasonable prices.",,
Really enjoyed this place. Nice food. Good service. Has singing and dancing- very entertaining! Would recommend to anyone celebrating an occasion.,,
"Very busy restaurant with entertainment thrown in. American type food Ribs, burgers etc. It's always busy when you go by and sometimes you have to queue to get seated. Friendly staff.",,
"We were recommended this place by some guests we met in the hotel.    Wow - the menu is vast and the food is amazing.  The portion sizes are huge so be careful if you order a starter first.  We had mussels to start which were absolutely lovely. I had pasta carbonara which was great. My OH had fillet steak which he said was one of the best steaks he had in years, enough to make him want to return for a second visit during our holiday.    Staff are incredibly friendly and ensure you are happy.    The dancers work really hard and add the extra wow factor whilst enjoying good food.",,
"This is a very popular restaurant, and if you go early evening you will join a queue. Entertainment some evenings.",,
"Visited with family, my son loved the place as did his red blooded grandad !! It is what it is , not really sure why there's regularly queue' s but each to their own . Food very basic but lots of it , staff ok but probably too preoccupied posing about or eyeing up each other . I'm sure people don't go there expecting the dancing / performing to be of west end quality ( which is just as well ) and it's free so ..... My six year old son returned home with a feather from one of the girls costumes so it made his day!!!  Not my thing but it's clearly other people's ..",,
Best food. Very good prices. Shows. Very big portions. Good environment. Friendly waiters. We will visit again for sure.,,
"So very similar food to a Frankie and Bennys or TGI's, good service and with a small dancing performance thrown in for the experience. Would go ther again but nothing authentically Cypriot about here.",,
"The food is excellent and a great value for money, the cabaret show is quite entertaining and the staff is very friendly. The only place in Paphos where people que to get in and it is worth it.",,
The staff were lovely and welcoming! The food was great too! Whilst on holiday I don't usually eat at the same place twice! But the food here was so good that we came back for more!,,
"Pretty unusual to have a US style ribs restaurant in Cyprus. The ambience is pretty good and the music and dancing keeps the family entertained through dinner. We went early for cocktail hour - not freshly made, but inexpensive so expected. The food was decent, large portions and the rubs fell off the bone. Overall a good experience.",,
"had a lovely burger here, pretty family oreintated, nice service , we were lucky we got a seat , as there ended up a long queue go early",,
Went here last Friday night with my family while we were on holiday.absolutely worth a visit.it was packed but the service was excellent the food was delicious and the portions were huge.would recommend you visit if you are in paphos,,
"Great food, lots to choose from, friendly staff, warm and welcoming, between 6-7pm is 2 for 1 cocktails and 10% off the bill if you pay in cash. Dining experience interspersed with dancing girls - nice touch. Gets busy after 7pm, so be prepared to wait or book in advance. Evening entrainment for those dining later. Definitely worth a visit",,
If you travel to Paphos this is definatly the restaurant to visit. It is my birthday here and we found this gem accidentally. So glad we did. Staff are amazing. Food is the best we have eaten during our 2 days stay. The portions are huge and the prices are low. Three girls made amazing performance with many styles of dancing. Shockingly!,,
"We have used Fat Mama's for about nine years, always a 5 star experience, a few days ago, just before my birthday, we decided to have a meal there before my birthday. The menu's have changed since last year, the choice is less, but we were both happy to find the ""Ribs for two"" and the ""Hunters Chicken"" still on the menu. The ribs were served, they were fatty, bland, and the BBQ sauce was tasteless, we left more than half. The main meal was also served, the French Fries were in a mental pot, the chicken was tough and tasteless, the only thing with any taste was the bacon. Do you by any chance have a new Chef, if so, I would sack him and bring back the old standards. Your serving staff were informed of our disappointment, but nothing other than saying, ""I will tell the kitchen that you were not happy"". Very sad, a nice restaurant spoiled by somebody trying to save a few pennies with inferior food.  Roy and Carol Watkins, Stockport, UK",,
Food ok entertainment iffy not sure why it attracts so many people and the queues but not bad on the whole.,,
"Staff fantastic, food potions were massive and tasty (even though I have never had pasta with a Jacket pototo.)",,
Visited this restaurant with wife and two kids after reading reviews on TripAdvisor.    Was busy and had booked a table however really don't think they care less if you book or not.  Entertainment was dire and more laughable than enjoyable.  Food was ok though but just ok nothing really to rave about.  It's an ok restaurant with ok food.,,
"This is a great restaurant with great entertainment from 8 pm there are an array of dancers and singers who come out and entertain you, along with dressed up characters the kids will love to have a photo with. Food is American or Italian and I had superb burger and son said his spaghetti bolognese was best ever! Is a real event from which you will take great memories and a full belly!",,
"..... By a six year old.    We have been to paphos many many times and always swerved this place. However this time we had hired a car and our little boy wanted to visit so we went.    He loved it as there were a few awkward dances on and fat mama and some Woody looking cowboy came out. So yes he liked it and we will have to go back next year for him..    However, the food was rubbish. Utter rubbish. This place must be a golden mine - I believe it's always busy and there are queues - why I don't know...    I had the ribs..... Rubbish. Just basic ribs with sauce ladeled over them.    Missus had fajitas - completely tasteless. Not even a hint of spice.    Father in law had chilli and said it was excellent - I tried it and to be fair it was nice.    Mother in law - spag carbonara... Just ladeled out of a big pot I imagine...    Would I go back for any other reason than my little one wants to? Nope.    Overrated, mass produced production line making someone very rich.    If you don't have kids that may like the brief dancing and people dressed up as fat mama then please don't waste a night of your holiday - go and eat some proper food elsewhere.",,
"The food was nice, not amazing, but nice. (I would recommend the vegetarian nachos!) There was also entertainment, every 20 mins or so, people would come out and dance! It was a lovely place and I would recommend it! (Also, all the waiters were spoke English! Perfectly!)",,
"another lovely place to eat,and some entertainment as well while you eat..good choice of food and drinks..and freshly cooked..servive good and friendly staff to..alway busy so get there early.........",,
"This is by far the best restaurant in phaphos, we ate 3 times in our weeks holiday. Not for the faint hearted the meals are massive, simply the best",,
"We went here when on holiday in Paphos.  Great place, good food (and lots of it), friendly staff.  When seated, they asked if there was any special occasion. At that moment we did not know why, but soon afterwards it became clear that for birthdays, anniversaries, and the like there are 3 lovely ladies who will do a dance and come to celebrate your occasion.",,
"When your wife and your son both say it's the best meal all week and they could eat it again, then you know it's good. The little man had a huge boss hog burger which was cooked to perfection. My wife had sea bass, again a first class meal and the carbonara was just right although the large portion was just too much. The service was excellent. We will definitely be back.",,
"Visited with my wife and kids for dinner i had heard great things and we were not dissapointed staff were polite and helpful and food was very tasty,prices were reasonable sad they close for the winter but will be back soon",,
"This place was fantastic. Absolutely great food and plenty of it, cheesy garlic bread is out of this world and you get 4 massive pieces so i recommend you share. We ate here twice and i can recommend the ribs and carbonarra. The staff are so friendly and nothing is a problem for them. This place was my favourite and is great value for money due to the quality and portion size. The cocktails are lovely as well. Fantastic atmosphere with dancers and fat mama and cowboy make an appearance every night.",,
"We have been here a few time entertainment is fab. Food as been up and down over the years, but don't let this put you off going",,
It was OK not the best but not the worst food. Entertainment was good....go if it's your birthday 🎂,,
"We visited Fat Mamas on 18th July 2017 for our wedding anniversary. The entertainment while you dine us impressive as is the food. Reasonably priced as well, nachos and potato skins for six to share six mains and alcoholic drinks (lots) €137  The glasses of champagne we were given after being sung to and introduced to everyone is a nice touch.  If you are in Paphos a visit to this restaurant is an absolute must!",,
"Love this place, the food is great, large portions, lots of choice and not bad prices. Dancers a little tacky but all for gud fun.",,
"Have visited this place a few times over the years but wont go back when in Paphos again. The food is not as good as it was - I was really looking forward to my pizza and it was a big let down. Most of the staff look like it is an effort to serve you, there was one girl that was very pleasant and helpful. The staff used to help to make the place but don't anymore. The show girls were not much good either. Wish we had gone else where.",,
"Visited on recommendation, wish we hadn't bothered. Started off so well but then it all started to fall apart as we felt like we were being watched the whole time we had food and drink in front of us and the waiting staff were hovering to snatch empty plates and glasses away the second you had finished with them. I was the last to finish my main course and was actually still chewing my last mouthful as my plate was whisked from under my nose and I was asked if I'd enjoyed it. I was brought up not to speak with my mouth full so I couldn't actually answer the question. The next to disappear was my cocktail glass, I had just placed my glass down when it was snatched away, I was asked if I wanted another and when I said no the glass mat was whisked away too.    This is one of the few places we have eaten whilst on our 2 week holiday, where we haven't been left to eat at our leisure and enjoy our evening, both myself and my friends felt rushed and unwelcome. It was as if they wanted to get you in and out. Wouldn't have minded if they were busy and needed the tables but they weren't and they didn't.    Won't be rushing back.",,
"You will recognise the menu it's just like chains across uk with all the Italian,American and Mexican favourites but done of course in a British way.However the product is better made with better service so if playing it safe on a budget or with fussy eaters absolutely the place to go.  If your based near tombs of the kings road easy walk if nearer the harbour probably need to get the bus.  It can get busy and you may need to book that should be proud enough that it is good food at a good price.",,
"It's not often I give a bad review but this time I can't help it. This place used to be a favourite of mine and came quite a lot as was local. I've been away from that island 4 years and have come back for a week. Recommended it to a close friend and have to say I'll not be returning. The portions are half the size, the ""dancing"" is just annoying now and found (Not all) the staff to be quite rude. Had to argue our bill as got charged €71 for drinks! It's just not the same, I feel they're just trying to use the name and passed reputation to fleece you out of your money. Not recommended at all I'd not go back again even if it was free. Oh and the spag boll was revolting. Go and find yourself a local taverna and enjoy your night.",,
"Not a great experience to be honest.  We were a table of 11 and an overall group of 18. We arrived in time for the 2 for 1 cocktails which were merely the same alcohol split between 2 and topped up with pre bought cocktail mix. I complained but no action was taken.  The meals are big portions but again the overall quality is lacking for the price.  Onto the actual meals; I had ribs and instead of it coming with the hot sauce it was BBQ. I asked twice until they finally took it to the kitchen on my 3rd request and brought the exact same ribs (now cold) back to me with an added layer of hot sauce added. The fajitas again were plentiful but the price paid for 'steak' was a little disingenuous as it was mainly veg. We had two 12 year olds share a pizza and pasta but the pizza wasn't cooked through and the dough was raw in places.  The place was packed and the staff were too busy to deal with issues.  Not a good €250 spend although the dancers were good.  No ""thank you"" or ""come again"" as we were leaving.  Needless to say, I won't be back.",,
"Visited twice as a family of four. To be honest, the food was average, but you get what you pay for. On the very positive side it is a lively restaurant with happy and helpful staff. There is entertainment on which is something a little different from most other restaurants in the area. It's always busy with a good atmosphere and we had two really good nights here. Would definitely recommend for the overall experience!",,
"We are frequent visitors to Fat Mammas and the food is still as great as the first time we went.  Portions are very generous, staff and service is perfect and the entertainment never fails to deliver.  Every evening has different entertainment and the the evening showcase is really great.  Looking forward to our next visit.  Thank you",,
"Visited this restaurant three time while on holiday. Each time we visited the restaurant the staff were great, friendly and very accommodating. On the third visit it was my sons 13th birthday, again the staff were fab singing happy birthday and bringing out a birthday cake which we had brought to the restaurant. The portions are big and good value for money. Would certainly recommend a visit, great food and atmosphere.",,
Excellent restaurant withe a very nice variety of dishes! The food was delicious!! The view is very nice and located in a very nice area! They have shows with an amazing team making our stay more pleasant!,,
"Great food just make sure your hungry because you will need to be to clear your plate, I had to be rolled back to our hotel",,
The meal was ok but seems to be very overpriced compared to other places. If you want load music and dancers then it's for you if you a quiet meal then no it's not going to be.,,
We had a lovely meal and entertained .get there early because after 7.30 people were queuing .two for one cocktails before 7.,,
"One of the best places to visit in Paphos, food is amazing, so much to choose from on their menus with a great variety! Entertainment is fantastic, thats why Fat Mama's is always top of my list when i visit paphos every year! Highly recommended! Thumbs up from me",,
"Having been ten years since I last came here I wasn't disappointed, there was a small queue to get in but nothing major. The entertainment was fantastic which meant we forgot to pick our food! The restaurant provides two sets of menus for the food, ""Willy's and fat mama's ""  The food was tasty and we didn't have any complaints, this is definitely worth a visit.",,
What a fantastic meal and the small portion was more than enough for me. My husband had a large portion and couldn't finish it. The staff were very friendly and there was also a cabaret show whilst dining. Reasonably priced too.,,
Great food . Excellent service. Enjoyable entertainment. Well worth a visit. Just beware the portion sizes are huge.,,
Great food. Great entertainment. Would definitely recommend the ribs and steaks. Cheap cocktails what else can you ask for !,,
I booked this restaurant seeing how busy it was we shared garlic bread with cheese very nice followed by chicken fajitas which came with a bowl of chips and three tortilla wraps in a bag my meal was quite nice my wife's meal was the naked burger with fries which she didn't enjoy the taste of it wasn't to her liking we shared a dessert of chocolate cake service was very good not to sure about the entertainment though.,,
Really good restaurant! Great variety of food and drink. The pizzas are to die for. We had the stuffed mushrooms aswell which were fab. Only around 8-12 euro per head go go go!,,
Had a fantastic birthday at Fat Mamas. Was recommended by a friend and we weren't disappointed. Food excellent and value for money and entertainment was good on the night.,,
Surprised my daughter on her birthday flew in from the uk to join her 🤷‍♀️ Great food and entertainment I have been here a few times now to eat great value 🎂,,
A lot of options to eat. Very kind serves. The Entertainment was good and after all good place to hang out. The wine is very good,,
"Visited Fat Mamas twice on our holiday to Paphos. Highly recommend going to this restaurant. Staff lovely, drinks are great, can recommend the ""Dirty"" waiter.... Very nice. What can I say about the food.... Bloody Lush. Just don't eat All day before your visit.. portion size is big, even the small portion was too big!!!    The show was great, we were lucky enough to be there when the Mum was singing such a lovely lady, and her 2 sons absolutely lovely guys .    Great night had by all x",,
Have eaten here a few times over the years and it's average at best. The atmosphere is good and staff are friendly and helpful but the food is average. Also not sure why they dancing waiters/waitress's at random points of the night but I guess it makes them different. It's not somewhere I would chose to go but if I'm with a group of people who want to I won't say no. Average at best,,
Well we are always come to fat mamas when in Cyprus and it was beautiful again this time my son came with us and he's a fussy eater and he loved it ! My daughter who's 10 this is her favourite restaurant she loves the food and really loves the dances and this time she meet the mascots !,,
Always a experience going to Fat Mamas Good food and larger than average portions and always friendly staff,,
Defintly a must if you visit paphos. Amazing food and amazing staff. The food is mouth watering and so much of i t,,
Excellent well worth a visit . Booking is advised as gets very busy . Spare ribs are very good but only get the small portion as you get plenty. Great for entertainment especially if you have a birthday or other special occasion 😊,,
Lovely food and excellent service. The entertainment was very good also. I would recommend eating here. Lovely lively place with delicious food.,,
We had a lovely time here. Excellent value for money. Food delicious. Service wonderful. Very busy though.,,
The food was delicious I had steak the first time and burger the second time the meals are very large the staff are all very friendly and there's entertainment as well well worth a visit u need to book if in a large party as very popular,,
Always go to fat mamas when in Paphos as all the family love it there. Sadly on this occasion I feel it did not match up to the high expectations and experience that we have had there past visits.  It is a shame as it was always a highlight for a trip to Paphos to go. The food is nice but a little bit pricey now and very small not like past visit. I will go back at some point as others in my party do enjoy it still,,
"We came to celebrate with family and friends our 29th Wedding anniversary. We had such a good night. Friendly staff, great food and cabaret. We had been recommended to visit by friends back home in Thailand and we were not disappointed. Thank you for helping us celebrate!",,
"Me and my partner came to visit on the 8th July, we always wondered why it was busy and people queuing so we thought we see what the crack is!  Well well you can see where fat mama name came in to this! Lol  Staff was fantastic!  Entertainers on go, never quiet.  If you don't want to be interrupted whilst eating then don't go! As it never quiet but it's all good :)",,
"Been here twice in our wee holiday - for 4 very simple reasons;  1. Represents excellent value for money - not only prices out even the most budget places, but the size of portions means you can share or eat small and quality is not compromised. They even perfect a blue fillet.  2. Staff - if they're not enjoying their work, you wouldn't know it. Nothing's too much hassle and they go out their way to please without being in your face or pushy.  3. Entertainment - kids love it. It's all night. It's loud. It's fun.  4. Overall experience - when you combine the above, you leave a happy customer - and even re-book.",,
We visited far mama's for a quick dinner before flying home on 8th July. The offers they have on if paying cash are amazing. The menu had loads of options even for fussy eaters. Portion sizes are huge. Myself and my husband both had the small portion of ribs. When they arrived we could have split them between the two of us. The prices are also really good. Quite a cheap menu considering what you get. The waiting staff were great with out daughter and kept her fully entertained through out the meal. Great place to eat. Would go back to Cyprus just to eat here!!,,
"We stayed at Kefalos village beach hotel and this restaraunt is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel  The food is amazing especially the burgers! There is a great menu selection, in fact there are 2. Italian and American. The Italian had food like pasta, pizza, spaghetti Bolognese e.t.c and the American had burgers rib e.t.c you can mix and match across the 2  The food portion are HUGE! Very good value for money  Staff are friendly and attentive too",,
We have been eating in Fat Mamma's for a number of years & again we were looking forward to going there again. What a disappointment! The once famous plateful of French fries has been replaced with a small portion of thicker chips in a seperate dish.. The hunters chicken we had last night was awful. The chicken itself was served up in a seperate dish which was then placed on the plate. It tasted as though it had just been heated up in the microwave & there was no sauce on the chicken. It's a shame it's gone downhill in this way,,
"A must to visit. This is a busy restaurant with entertainment thrown in. The food was excellent and plentiful, and good value for money. The staff were helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble. The ribs are to die for",,
Food and service pretty good. The portions are large and the price is reasonable. There is a show that comes on every hour or so which adds spirit to it. Recommended for kids.,,
"If you like ribs, pizza and pasta and a lot of noise you will like this but beware of the large portions and anything with seafood in it",,
"Fat Mamas is one of the main ""iconic"" restaurants down Tomb of the Kings Road, and for of being notoriously overpriced it is a let down to say the least. With 5 microwaves on show, it was obviously that our starter of BBQ ribs had come from there. The staff seemed oblivious to customers, completely the opposite to the majority of other restaurants down the same road.    The main dishes came promptly which in a very busy restaurant is good but I couldn't help thinking the microwave was used again to blast out dish after dish? The burger tasted mediocre, dry and lacked flavour. Came with a good portion of fries and salad. Tried to enjoy this but dancing and cabaret took place and eating my meal became uncomfortable, which I deliberated finished early as my table appeared pretty much on stage.    Overall a disappointing evening and this was the only English food we ate all holiday, Cypriot food has tasted a lot fresher and less greasy.    If you want overpriced underwhelming food with poor service then please visit here!...If you want reasonable priced food that is freshly cooked visit any other place in Cyprus",,
"This restaurant is the nuts, sloop much choice I took ages to decide.staff very friendly and they do 5mins little shows, i would definitely go back to try something different.",,
"Last night in the area on family break and we had a lovely meal here. Live show during the evening made the experience memorable. Awesome burgers and kids had pizza which were also good. Good value for money and cannot fault the service with friendly helpful staff, definitely recommend.",,
"If in Paphos you must definitely go to Fat mamas.  I read many reviews on trip advisor and thought I must see for myself. So me and my partner went on a Thursday evening and it was extremely busy.manage to get a seat,ordered a drink then 3 ladies and a man came out and started dancing. This definitely passed the time when waiting for food. We had ordered 2 margarita pizzas, coleslaw and cheese cake for dessert. Every time I go abroad the pizza always tastes different, but this time hallelujah!!! They were not, theses pizzas were absolutely gorgeous( one of the best I've tried)  The cheese cake was lovely too, only downside on the dessert was they put far to much sauce on it so it lost its flavour a bit.  The atmosphere was lively, someone was celebrating a birthday,so the dancer came out with a pint and sang happy birthday to him. Then a couple were getting married so the dancers came out with champagne and sang to them. So there was a lot of audience participation. The price of the food and drinks was reasonable.....  YOU MUST GO!",,
Definately would recommend. Advise to book as gets very busy. Burgers were big and cooked to perfection. Quick service. Dancers kept popping out for the entertainment.. not very good but it was ok. Excellent value for money.,,
"3rd time eating here in 3 years, never disappointed food is well priced and the portions are over sized.. Would recommend booking anytime in main summer months.",,
We ate at fat mamas a few times and were never disappointed. If anything there was too much at times. Please try it's great,,
"We visited twice it was that good.  The service is prompt, the food is great and the entertainment is fun.    I'd read on here a few people saying the pasta wasn't great so opted for the burgers and ribs, a small plate is more than enough, I love my food and I couldn't finish it so god knows how big the large ones are!!    The staff are friendly and attentive and the lads that get involve with the dancing girls are great to watch.",,
"well what can i say about fat mamas ( brilliant) once again staff really friendly very attentive, and the portions massive you will be really full once you come out. and the entertainment never stops makes the night special, thanks Fat Mamas will see you next year",,
Fantastic food and service a must when your in paphos iv been 4 times now and it's always been good food service and entertainment,,
"Had food here on the last night of our stay in Cyprus. Food, drinks and all staff were friendly. Entertainment was brilliant. Singing and dancing. Would highly recommend",,
"This is a busy restaurant, and I would advise to book. What makes this restaurant different is the breaks every 20 minutes or so, with dancing and singing. The girls who dance and sing are very good and it breaks up the meal and is fun to watch. The food is good, but not excellent, so the entertainment makes up for it. We had a fun night and we would visit again. My grandson and daughter loved it.",,
Has two menus - italian and american - you can choose from both. The portions are HUGE. Everyone really enjoyed their meal and there is a little entertainment whilst you eat. Gets very bush after 7pm so if you don't book you will have to wait. Highly recommended,,
Fantastic can't recommend it enough. If your in the area go to this restaurant. The food is fantastic the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The Nachos are a must plate size of a dustbin lid and delicious.,,
Food was average. Entertainment mediocre only lasted about 15 minutes. Think this place is overrated. Much better food at Dias next door.,,
"Very beautiful place with tasty foods and good prices! Defiantly gonna visit it again soon and I hope I 'll not end up a ""fat mama""!",,
"Good entertainment, large variety of 2 menus to choose from and good portions. Good location too. I'd recommend the supersized portion.",,
Every time we visit my auntie we go to fat mama's restaurant we make sure we go for 8pm so we don't miss out on there entertainment. The waiters and waitresses put on a cabaret act whilst you dine and they are fantastic. The food is also fantastic and you can't beat this restaurants atmosphere it's amazing.,,
"Had the rattlesnake steak done medium rare and it was amazing with the spicy sauce, the only place in Cyprus we ate that seemed to have proper food.",,
"Three of us visited and we were all impressed with the service and the quality and quantity of the meals (we had small portions not the mamas portions and it was sufficient, you can chose your own size). I would highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread starter it was the best I have ever had (loved it). Three of us dined, 1 starter to share, 3 main meals (1 was a beautiful filet steak) plus two soft drinks each and 2 mojitos (which were perfect) and the bill was €60 which was very reasonably priced. The place also had entertainment (singing and dancing) which added to the bustling atmosphere. Highly recommended and we would all return in a heartbeat.",,
We had had a few meals at Cypriot taverners in paphos and sampled some local dishes and decided we wanted to try something different. This might not be everyone's cup of tea but it was definitely entertaining! It was a lively 'american style' restaurant.  We sat down and ordered a pizza and then had a surprise when dancing girls came on stage! They were very energetic and had a few outfit changes. It was fun and entertaining while we ate.,,
Great food entertainment throughout the evening . Just don't ask for the large meal you will be there a week trying to finish it . Very clean and great service would recommend booking in advance as does get very busy,,
Eaten here before so was disappointed with the food this time. Staff very good which didn't make up for the food.,,
"Entertainment makes this place a lot better. Food was ok nothing amazing , friendly staff very attentive . Would come back",,
"Expected alot more from here, the food was poor. Would not recommend. Both me and a friend had pasta and couldn't eat it.",,
"After reading reviews on here decided it's worth a visit, if it wasn't for the reviews we wouldn't have walked the 2.5 miles from our hotel. On arriving there were but one get one free soft drinks, perfect after the walk, 2 menus with so much variety I couldn't imagine anyone not finding a dish to try, my partner is vegetarian and there were so many choices she was amazed. I decided to have the ribs, and my partner the halloumi fajitas, OMG the portions are enormous and the taste fantastic, we have massive appetites and we struggled to finish everything. As we finished the buy one get one free cocktails started so it would of been rude not to. Would definitely come here again.",,
"Massive homemade burgers😁😁 keptkids and wife happy, I had steak.😁😁 Cheap drinks between 5 and 6 pm.",,
We were a party of seven and had heard good reports about this restaurant. It was superb. Food was excellent and live entertainment was extremely good. Definitely worth a visit.,,
The name says it all - the portions are v large and the staff are lovely. I am not sure if this happens every night but on our visit they entertainment which was a nice surprise. The choice of food is great and the price is too - we were going to order two starters for my husband and myself but the waiter pointed out the name and said that they would be large so we changed to one - a good job we did - we would never have eaten one each!,,
Couldnt of asked for a nicer place to eat on our last night. The burgers are lush my mam who is very fussy even liked it too! wish we had of visited early in our trip as i would of definately been a few time during our holiday. Drinks were buy one get one free when we went too.,,
"Visited here 3 times in our weeks holiday to paphos, says it all really. EXCELLENT food, fab staff, brilliant entertainment. Couldn't fault this place at all. My only advice if you plan on eating here, starve yourself all day, even the small portions are too big!! Best place to eat in Paphos, would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone",,
"this restaurant is by far the best in paphos, the staff are friendly, very helpful, wide range on the menu and the portions are huge. we ended up coming here every night.",,
"Fat Mamas, like many of the restaurants on The Tomb of the Kings road is a smashing place to eat, huge portions, great atmosphere, not expensive, but there are so many others. Like Tramps for breakfast. Staying at The Kefalonitis Apartments we never had a bad meal anywhere. All friendly staff, and good value everywhere. You could do a different one for breakfast and dinner and not be disappointed.  Paphos, just go.",,
"When in Paphos on our holiday we tend to have a meal in this restaurant at least once a week. The staff are excellent and the food is brilliant and plentiful. The entertainment is good also. The only thing that spoils it for us and it's the same in all restaurants is if you want to sit outside you have to sit with the smokers, it would be so much nicer if the smokers had an area outside that is separate from the non smokers.",,
"Our second time back to Fat Mama""s over 2 holidays, all i can say is WOW..... Lovely food , lovely atmosphere, well worth a visit.",,
Value for money great and good for family- possibly a bit wasteful as portion size so big. American diner but why when you're in Cypress!,,
"Please do not waste your time waiting outside to be seated this is an ongoing business strategy, to make the restaurant look busy. Once inside the food is nothing brilliant I have made better pasta dishes at home show is OK. The staff do work very hard.",,
"WOW this place is bomb! We visited it twice while we were in Paphos for 2 weeks. There is a bit of a line and wait but it goes pretty fast and the wait is worth it. The food is so delicious, the portions are huge! The entertainment is a bit cheese but it goes with the holiday mode so we loved it. We will always return here when in Paphos!",,
"Great if you are here on holiday but as a resident there are better places to eat, everybody tries it once",,
"We always visit here when we come to Cyprus! Food lovely, good size portions & service good! A little expensive. Good but cheesy entertainment! Picture I took was of the mother & son that didn't look up from their mobile devices! Disgusting 😢",,
"A must .. Massive meals without compromising on flavours. Staff are excellent , with the staff putting on singing & dance routines all night. Well worth the wait , if there is a queue . Will be returning soon 😃",,
"Close to our hotel and didn't fancy the evening menu so called in at Fat Mamas which seems to share its kitchen with a similar , attached restaurant called Big Willys . Both menus were virtually identical , just printed in different order .    Service was not quick but food arrived hot . I had the ribs and my partner had a burger .    Portions were good and tasty .    Unknown to us , it was cabaret night which came as a surprise . Short musical interludes with dancing girls throughout the evening culminating in a longer act at the end which involved the dancers and some of the restaurant staff .    An entertaining evening indeed , and at a very acceptable price .    I don't know if the cabaret happens every night but we were there on a Sunday",,
"With an extensive menu, friendly and quick service, and live entertainment, Fat Mamas is a nice way to spend the evening. Portion sizes were really good and meals very reasonably priced (large steak was only 25 euro). The only thing stopping us giving a five, is that some of the food was a little bland.",,
6 of us celebrated my sister's 65th birthday at Fat Mammas. The entire experience was 1st class The food was amazing. The staff were very attentive and helpful. The staff also put on a floor show which was very good.,,
Called in for a short time for cheeky cocktail one evening but wish we could have stayed longer. The staff were really attentive and friendly and the food that other people were having looked very good.,,
"Had a lovely meal here one evening was a bit pricey but we really enjoyed it, it's very popular with people queuing to get in at times.",,
"Visited twice during our recent visit to Paphos. Portions of food are massive so be careful when ordering.  For the kids Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy come 'out' from the kitchen in costumes and kids get the chance to have their photos taken with them  Singers and dancers in middle of restaurant every few minutes brightens up the night.  staff happy to discuss different items on the menu.  Only drawback, if you don't book your table you may need to queue up to get in but worth the wait",,
"Huge portions, I have to start my review by mentioning that. I ordered the BBQ ribs which I really enjoyed, cooked very well- meat just fell off the bone as it should. There are 2 menus which you can mix and match, Italian and American. Every 15 minutes or so, dancers come out for a minute which was quite entertaining. The restaurant had a fair amount of locals inside which is always a good sign. Staff very polite and friendly. Food was pretty decent but nothing special. The prices were very fair for the huge portions given. Even kids meal for 6 Euro was huge. I can't fault the place to be honest, however I rate it 4/5, not quite a 5/5 experience.",,
"Went here for a family meal. Couldn't rate the place highly enough, massive choice, generous portions and the quality is unbelievable. Had the Rattlesnake Steak and it's arguably the best cut of meat I have ever had! If your in Paphos you have to play this place a visit!",,
We live In paphos and have eaten there many times and food has bin very nice. But this time awful the hunters chicken was gray no flavour thrown on a plate. Put us of completely shame as had some great times there ruined the whole meal. Pizza was under done in middle to. We did speak to waitress and her people skills were amazing and she did take it of the bill credit to her. And horrible to say me and my partner was left feeling ill after maybe as it such a popular restaurant they r rushing orders and maybe caught them on a bad day not good enough,,
We have visited Fat Mamas regularly for years but the last 2 years we have been disappointed by the food quality - I had lasagne which was huge but terrible quality - one of the worst ever. Sadly there are many restaurants in Paphos were the food quality is miles better so we won't be back.,,
"Me and my partner came here for dinner last night. Having never been to Paphos before we asked our rep for suggestions on where to eat.  The service at the restaurant was very quick and the portions were huge. We ordered the bruschetta to start and it was more than enough for two people.  We were quite surprised to find there was cabaret entertainment, loud music and dancing which isn't really our scene as we prefer a quiet adult setting, but for those diners who had young children it was a great addition to the experience as the children were entertained.  They also made a very big fuss if you were celebrating e.g. Wedding anniversary or birthday.  The food is not authentic Cypriot/Greek, it serves American, Italian and Mexican.  However from the onset this is made clear and so if you fancy a fun night with food that you could get at home, this is your place!  Only 4 stars because it wasn't our sort of place.",,
I checked this restaurant out before I went to Paphos. The food and service was outstanding and good value. If you go make sure you are hungry because the portions are big. We had nacho to start with and then burgers which I have to say was a proper 100% beef. I will return in August when next in Paphos.,,
went here for a meal and was not happy about the food at all . steak was not good at all and to be honest it was our meal was just a small steak if it was steak it was like a charcoal grill you get out a box from birds eye and then hundreds of chips put on top .would not use this place again.,,
Nice restaurant with excellent service and dansing show .price list is good money for value jusf try it.,,
If your wanting a quiet undisturbed romantic dinner. I don't think this is for you.  It's and entertaining fun filled night with active staff who fully engage with the customer. The dance troop are good fun. And keep little ones guessing what's coming next. I was introduced to this restaurant by my father and I have now bought my granddaughter who loved it.  Keep up the good work and compliments to the chefs lol x,,
"We went here for a bit to eat while having a look around the local area, was very welcoming and staff so friendly..",,
Had dinner in here twice while on holiday. The food was amazing and the staff where lovely. Thank you fat mamas,,
"This place is a definite must when you are in Paphos, every time we are in Paphos we make sure that we visit this place at least once! Cannot recommend it highly enough",,
Very busy food just ok. Dancers were good. There's a variety of food house wine wasn't very nice. Had another wine it was expensive.,,
"Friday night decided to go out early to paphos for dinner 6 of us. We notice a que outside fat mamas and the inside was busy. That's it we're going there. I dropped everyone of out side and parked the car at O'Neill over the road by the time I crossed the road to fat mamas we were in and sat down. We ordered nachos for starter 7euro and it fed the 6 of us easy for a starter then five of us had steak and one had canaloni all the meals were delicious service was great very helpful girl called Megan.There is even entertainment with girls dancing overall pretty excellent to be honest with you, just a note my wife and dad said the steaks were a little cheery towards the end but we all enjoyed it thank you.",,
"Absolutely fabulous, food was delicious and warm atmosphere, highly recommend and the portions are huge",,
"Just come back from Paphos where we are at Fat Mama's on our last evening. Was there early, between 5 and 6 pm they have 10% discount on food and offers on drinks and it's quiet; this restaurant gets very busy later in evening. Service was good and staff were very friendly and accommodating. Steak was lovely but my children weren't impressed with the spaghetti dish which they said was tasteless and bland. Great pizza's that you can create yourself with a good selection of toppings. Overall would recommend",,
Strange entrance at first as you think it's 2 separate restaurants as there are 2 names but it's 1.  Service is good. Food is very good and very large portions and the price is very reasonable.  Entertainment provided with dancers and singers.  Well worth the visit.,,
"Excellent food, with fast service. Popular in paphos for the good price list. I recommend this restaurant and definitely will come back",,
Enjoyed dining here on my recent trip to paphos. The shows were an added bonus. A must visit for any traveller coming to this area,,
"We went for a meal as I went there 8 years ago and remembered how good it was so had to go again!  The food was just as tasty as I remembered, we ordered the small plates for our mains and still found them to be big enough to be full after!  The entertainment was great, the dancing was good and just added that little bit extra sparkle to the place!",,
"We has a meal here on the last night before we came back to UK, we were not disappointed. The staff were very friendly and the food was out of this world. Make sure you are hungry when you visit,",,
"I had late dinner with friends at this place the other night, and it was nothing like what we have expected. Being a recommendation from a people that live in Paphos, we were expecting a good experience. The food was of poor quality. Big portions but unfortunately tasteless. I had spaghetti Bolognese, and it was just a pile of tasteless minced meat on a pasta. In the end I just decided not to eat it.",,
"This is our second time in Cyprus and our 1st visit to fat mama's. Food is brilliant, service exceptional, staff friendly and very good entertainment. We will be back again!! Thank you for a lovely night",,
"The evening we visited the service was fine and the staff friendly. It was not overly busy and we did not have to wait long for the food which was served hot. There was nothing bad about the food, just OK for a family restaurant. On a positive note the entertainment was amusing.",,
The staff friendly and the service was excellent. You could not fault the food in any way the spare ribs were excellent and the desserts very good,,
"love the food here, visited many times, food is amzing but entertainment was a little dissapointing and not as good as previous visits",,
We've dined here for years and had to visit when staying in Paphos for a week's holiday. And as ever it was fabulous!!!! Even better than we remembered! Yes the portions are big but the quality is big too!!! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was five star! As ever the evenings entertainment made a welcome addition to our meal and we loved it! Thank you so much Fat Mammas for exceeding our past happy memories!!! You are all wonderful!!!,,
"Lovely food & great service, we couldn't get in the first night because it was sooooooooo busy. We all agreed that the food was very good & would return.",,
Wow the food here is so good you could eat her for breakfast lunch dinner and never get bored of it. Only thing they need to is advertise opening times.,,
We have been here before so knew not to order too much food as the portions are big.... Lovely food won't be dissapointed,,
"We have been visiting Fat Mama's for the last 5 years, this year sadly not for the better. Other years we have been the Ribs were absolutely covered in thier delicious sauce but this year very little to be seen. There was no alternative to chips whereas other years jacket potatoes were available. Not going into anymore detail apart from adding we will NOT be returning. Sad really.",,
We tried this restaurant on recommendation the choice on the menu is very good we had the fillet steak it was cooked beautifully just as I like it the meal was very small an very expensive for what you got,,
"Food was lovely, not to pricey, 8 of us went and got different meals, all enjoyed them lovely clean place",,
Spending 2 weeks in paphos I can say this was the best restaurant we have eaten in the food was excellent and the waiting staff are fantastic especially Megan who spent time explaining everything to us and making sure our order was correct. I would recommend the stake and pizzas and we are deffinatly calling again.,,
"Went their for dinner. Decent food, with a great selection of different dishes. Very friendly and efficient staff. Meagan was on top of it all. Thanks a lot for a nice evening.",,
Amazing food and entertainment I been here 4 times in my 10 days in paphos. There is two menus available here been Italian and Mexican American. The cocktail are grate too. There is entertainment thru out the night been dancers there amazing loved fat mammas.,,
Went with friends to celebrate a birthday. Service is friendly and the food superb. The portions are large....the ribs especially. The food tastes great though. There are regular slots of dancing girls and it makes the night brillkiant.,,
"Fast food American style, they like to get you in and out to make room for other customers queuing to get in. Not a relaxing atmosphere.",,
"Visited Fat Mama's around 6pm this evening and wasn't disappointed. Extensive menu with a lot of tasty vegetarian options as well. Plenty of staff as I believe it gets very busy late on as so popular and you can see why. Staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble, service with a smile. Food was great and the portions are massive and well worth the money. Dancers were just coming out too start the entertainment as we were leaving. Highly recommend visiting this restraunt if you get chance!",,
"Visited this for some early evening down time after a full on day at the brewery.    Meagan was our waitress and she was very friendly, attentive and helpful.    Because we went early it was very quiet and we didn't see any of the evening entertainment, although we did meet the ladies who were pretty lovely.    We stayed for a couple drinks and had some ribs that were delicious. food and drinks here are really good and i thought the prices were very reasonable. Would definitely recommend Fat Mama's and would suggest going a little later than we did.",,
We came here about 12 years ago and the food was great. We came on holiday May 2016 and took our children here and they loved it! We are holidaying in Paphos again in August so we will be visiting Fat Mamas,,
Went with a group of friends. Cocktails were moderate. Service was excellent however my wife had Chilli Con and this was decidedly poor and hardly any chilli. I had pasta I forget the name with seafood and the sauce was definitely odd and not pleasant. We had some starters to share which were fine.,,
Well we are always come to fat mamas when in Cyprus and it was beautiful again this time my son came with us and he's a fussy eater and he loved it ! My daughter who's 10 this is her favourite restaurant she loves the food and really loves the dances and this time she meet the mascots !,,
Came for tea for my daughter birthday the food was lovely and very big portions the staff was very quick to serve and was not left with out a drink. It is very clean and we had a lovely meal while watching the entrainment which the kids fully enjoyed and they came out and sang happy birthday to my daughter what was a added bonus.,,
Stayed in Paphos last October on bed and breakfast at the Elysium. It forced me to try different restaurants and as this was so close I couldn't ignore it. Had a very good steak with all the appropriate accompaniments. Was impressed by the entertainment and at how many people were there that night to celebrate a birthday! Well worth a visit.,,
Will definitely return to FM. We dined here several evenings. The staff are friendly and attentive. Great menu and the food was excellent. Was lovely watching the live entertainment from the comfort of our table will defintely go back.,,
Nice american style restaurant serving larger portions for the hungrier customer. I had rack of ribs which came with fries could of had some salad with it.Nice dancing show while we were eating. Would recommend,,
"I had lasagna and partner had steak all beautiful cooked we visit this place every time we visit cyprus, just go there being hungry or you will not finish your meal, perfect everytime",,
Had Ribs and a lovely burger! Well cooked and presented with lovely friendly staff! And the portions are very good too. Varied and interesting menu too! Well worth a visit! Good value,,
It was big food done well. Service was possibly too intense. We had the meat platter for starters and then burgers which were all good. I have been to quite a few American style restaurants like this and it was average to very good. I wouldn't return as there's too many other places to try or that we found a little better. Worth a go if you are very hungry.,,
"I like to try new places, so don't normally go back to the same restaurant twice, but Fat Mama's was the exception. 241 cocktails between 6-7, food was good quality and good portions. Entertainment was lively and fun. All staff were excellent with special thanks to our waitress Megan.",,
We were taken by surprise by this restaurant as we thought we were going for a quite meal and then this music started up and 3 girls came out dancing to Abba.  When they finished we thought oh that was different and then 10mins later out they came again.  Alot of people probably go here for the entertainment which was good but if your out for a romantic or quite meal id give this a miss.,,
"We booked a table very last minute for 10 people, in the space of a 10 min taxi ride our table was completely ready by the time we got there. Fantastic entertainment, food is well presented and amazingly good! This place is well worth a visit, portion sizes on pasta dishes are huge! Can't wait to get back and try the rest of the menu!!",,
"I read the reviews glorifying this place and really shocked. Place looks nice, with show and everything, but food is really CRAP!    We were family of 7, ordered 5 main courses: 2 burgers, 1 sicilian chicken, 1 seabass fish, 1 pasta, they were all absolute DISASTER! The burgers were too salty and lukewarm, just not edible. My fish was lukewarm and tasted as if was not fresh, was dry, and in different temperature from the side vegetables that were warm. The Pasta of the kids was just tasteless, no flavor at all. Most of the food was just left uneaten...! :(    When we told them our review, they just said it's our problem and kicked us out, with no compensation whatsoever - needless to say we paid the full bill for food that I wouldn't feed my cat with!    A taxi driver that took us to the airport told us that because they are so crowded, they make the food up front, so it is served not fresh.    To summarize: awful experience, awful food, for us felt like a classic tourist trap.",,
Had a meal here and everything about it was fantastic the food and the staff are second to none. Megan was our waitress and she was superb. Very helpful and friendly without Being in your face. Hope we get her on our next visit!,,
"Staff are incredibly nice, the food came fast, (almost too fast... which questions if it was good fresh)    given that the restaurant wasn't that busy it felt like they were rushing us to go....    The main courses lacked seasoning... and was a bit bland. I ordered a jacket potato with my steak, and it was awful. Looked like it had been microwaved.    It was OK...",,
Great food but sometimes too much on the plate which can be off putting!    Staff all lovely and pleasant but sometimes too much in your face while your trying to enjoy your meal!    Cabaret shows are entertaining but not everyone's taste and if you visit more than once it feels like you are seeing the same thing but on a different day.    My little boy had a fall whilst there and when I spoke to the manager about the health and safety risks of having a wire across the floor he was very apologetic and attentive to my son but I was disappointed when he failed to cover the wire as my concern was that someone else could trip!,,
this is a really nice place to eat when you had your share of greek food- the staff is really nice the pizza was really good the burger a bit less but still ok portions are really big!!,,
"Food was great and there was plenty of it. Quick and well priced. They have live entertainment from 3 girls throughout the night and even though they try to entertain, they don't need to. We spoke to some people that said they wouldn't take their children as they do lift their legs pretty high......a child don't need to see what they can see.",,
"We didn't expect what we got here. We are 2 adults in our 60's and we thought it was fun, the birthday shows were great and the animated characters children and 60 year olds.    The food was also really nice and I would return put a smile our faces.",,
"Excellent food, hospitality and nice entertainment. Shared a fat mamas platter for a starter. Omg the size of it. We wouldn't have ordered a main course if we'd have known how much you got. Ribs were amazing, natchos just as good, chicken wings and loaded potato skins too. Couldn't eat half our main course after that lot.",,
"Lively restaurant with good entertainment and good food, two menus so plenty of choice!! Definitely worth a visit easy to get to on the bus from hotel we were in.",,
"If in Paphos you must not go home without a visit to Fat Mamas/willys rib ranch, word of warning don't eat much before hand, amazing food amazing staff and even get entertainment, don't forget to mention it's your birthday. Let the entertainers sing and dance for you .",,
We booked to come here after not been able to get in during summer season.we were not disappointed the staff were fantastic & very attentive to our every need.food portions for price were unbelievable & an added extra was the girls who seemed to be out every 5-10 minutes with different costumes & dance routines including a cabaret act at the end.highly recommend coming here,,
Food is very good and lots of it for a very fair price. Very friendly staff and good entertainment. Went twice in the week we stayed. If we return to Cyprus we will definitely go back to this restaurant.,,
"It's a great place to take kids, they'll love it but sad to say, not good for adults. If you don't want your children to eat junk food, don't take them.",,
"Fat Mamma's is an American themed restaurant with entertainment thrown in. They have dancers who appear every now and then so it's not throughout your entire meal. The food is fabulous, lots of choice, great cocktails, excellent service, children welcome and outside there is a resident face painter. If it's your birthday or any special occasion you should let them know and you'll be in for a treat. If you like good food in an entertaining environment then this is the place to go.",,
While the food is not exceptional the portions are large and you are certain not to leave hungry. In fact avoid a starter to enjoy the huge main course dishes.  Add in the troupe of dancing girls and you are all set for a good evening all round.,,
Food was tasty and there was enough on the menu for even the fussiest of eaters.    The staff were friendly and attentive.    This place is great if you have kids too. Dancers and fire eaters put on a great show that the whole family can enjoy.,,
Hilarious place ! We took the kids for my son's birthday and weren't really expecting to like but we had a really fun night.Amaxing night out for children and the food was good !,,
"Well, we've been coming here for years and I'm sorry to say that the last visit was poor. They've only just opened for the season and I hope they get new kitchen staff. The food was cold and dry. Not what we've come to expect.",,
"This is a must go place awesome food and service and cheap as chips gets mega busy so go early and get 10% discount .  Think it's been open many years and has a huge rep , best food I have had on this trip.  The kids will love the dancing girls .  Suspect dad will as well",,
"I was told by a friend to make a stop at Fat Mama's whilst on holiday and am I glad I did!    Huge portions of delicious food, great entertainment and reasonably priced. It was a fun place to be, but at the same time you could enjoy your meal in peace.",,
"Fat Mama's is definitely a great place to visit. They have great entertainment provided by their own staff while you eat your food but a word of warning, only choose the small portions (which are masssive) unless you have a huge appetite",,
On the main drag on Tomb of the Kings Road. This is a busy themed resturant with great entertainment during your meal. Lots going on throughout the night and every birthday gets celebrated the same way we can get a bit annoying with 5 on the night we went. It all keeps you entertained though and your mind of the mass processed not very good food. Lots of people recommended this too us and I cant say it was a bad experience just not a good one. Lots of choice and staff attentive and happy. Go and enjoy the fun,,
Fab for the family with great entertainment. Food portions are massive but mediocre (think frankie & bennys),,
Tex mex and an italian menu too. Portions are huge so they also give you the half portion option. The food is out of this world. You cant book so you have to show up and wait in line  You can wait at the bar too wich is cool as you can enjoy the continuous entertainment. Highly recommended to all specially hen and stag and birthday parties!,,
Great night out for families. Good entertainment with floor shows and great food at reasonable prices. It does get busy so best to book in summer season. Well worth a visit Opens next month,,
This is the best place in the world for food. Dream about coming back here. Please go for a meal you will not regret this.  Staff are great location is great food is great over all amazing.  I would just fly to Paphos just to go here then fly home.,,
"Great little spot in Budapest, nice drinks and live music! Sabrina offered us a great service will be back again!!",,
"Food fantastic every time we have visited. Try the enchilladas they're the best! HUGE portions, better to fast for the day before visiting ;) Also great cocktails. Staff always upbeat, happy and friendly. Good restaurant with a family and fun vibe.",,
We had been recommended to try this by friends back home...so thought why not    The atmosphere was great along with the service.. Staff couldn't do more for you if they tried..    Downfall was the food.. Big American portions but tasteless and greasy. Was a real shame as this place could have it all.,,
"Been here many many times. Great food, great fun staff, and they always shout compliments to the chef if you think the food is good. The portions are huge. Pre book if you can otherwise you'll be queuing down the street particularly in the summer months.",,
"Be very clear on what you want before joining the evening queue that stretches down the Tomb of the Kings road. This is all about American style food, portion sizes to match and above all entertainment. Transport yourself back to what wowed you as a child and the mini performances every 15 minutes and the grand finale at the end of the night will certainly keep you entertained.    My simple suggestion is this; put the tablets and mobiles away, have a good US style feast, watch the entertainment and have a good chat and laugh as a family. The perfect antidote to modern life!",,
well was always busy so we went to see whats all the fuss about. good show but nothing that special besides that,,
"Very over rated restaurant, over priced, average food, with poor, slow service. Would not recommend a visit!",,
"Absolutely fabulous place to eat!! BUT you have to be hungry to finish the plate, the portions are so big. We went there 4 years ago and just had to return last year when visiting Paphos. Highly recommended.",,
"Having been here a few times on previous trips to Cyprus, we was itching to get back after bragging about this to other fa,ily members who hadn't been. It didn't disappoint, great atmosphere, great entertainment, amazing food!!! All 5 shared the huge plate of nacho's as we told them about the bug portion sizes.... We all had mains, I chose the ribs, and there was so many I couldn't finish, so I had my little doggy bag to take home with me!! We All had 2-3 drinks, soft & alcoholic, it came to approx £30 per person...... Well & truly worth every penny & this is a must if you go to Cyprus!!! No where else there like it!    Good job guys X",,
"This is a great restaurant if you want constant entertainment with your dining and love american style portions with your food.  The food is a great quality, reasonably priced and plentiful. You will not need to order more than one course.  If you are looking for a typical American restaurant with entertainment that will keep children amused, this is the place for you. However this is not for those who would like a quiet meal or those that are looking for Cypriot menu.  For me it was a little too loud and hectic,it just wasn't my cup of tea. However my husband loved this place as he enjoyed change of pace from the typical Cypriot taverna.",,
"We always make a point of dining at Fat Mamas when in Paphos on at least one occasion and normally more. The menu choice is old but not local, ribs, burghers, sizzlers etc. Get there around 8 o'clock and get a table in view of the entrance area as that is where the amateur floor show starts at 9 o'clock. It is a good giggle put on by the staff. They also come over to your table and wish you a happy birthday, anniversary etc if you let your waiter/waitress know on arrival, in their own unique way. Good food and some fun light entertainment.",,
"Try it!  Want a big fulfilling burger, a nice pasta or a hot mexican dish, while enjoying live dance shows and friendly attending staff? This is the place to go. Make your way a little early because during summer it is packed with people. Never had any problems getting seated by the staff though.    A little note, avoid the pizzas. Not their thing. Everything else is ok to perfect.",,
"This was my girlfriends favourite restaurant when she was younger and I had the pleasure of going this summer. Food was great, portions were absolutely massive! That was the half portion can't imagine how big the full one would be. Service was quick and pleasant.The restaurant it's self was nice, the atmosphere was good and the entertainment was great. Suited both couples and familes.",,
"Went here early evening before we flew home. Did mean to book and go earlier in the holiday but never did. As always v busy when we walked past. As we Usually ended up down at the harbour. Had burgers, very tasty. I had carbonara- could only eat half as so much! This is a place to go if you are celebrating something as they have dancers that Hawaii dance (I think) late evening.",,
Enjoyed our visit fast efficient service good food & drink well worth a visit cant say anymore about this visit except its on the local bus route on an all day ticket and our family and friends enjoyed their visit to this establishment,,
"An American diner type of place that sold pizzas, fajitas, chicken wings, that kind of thing. My 9 year old thought it was great, as there were singing girls, people dressed in bit puppet outfits etc. Food was so so, drinks were fine but none of it was cheap. Strictly for kids, us adults did cringe a bit.",,
The best restaurant in Paphos!! We dined here 3 times in our ten day stay and it's absolutely fabulous. The steak fajitas are to die for... Masssssssive portions... Piping hot delicious food... Hard working and friendly staff.... Fantastic entertainment... CANNOT WAIT TO RETURN!!!,,
"WOW... what can I say. HUGE portions at very reasonable prices. Menu comes in either big or small portions which is great when you have children with you that don't eat the normal fish fingers or chicken nuggets that's usually on kids menu. All the staff were soo welcoming and very friendly, excellent service and they couldn't do enough for us. Would HIGHLY recommend the food. Ate here a few times and the service and food i couldn't fault at all.",,
tried this once again used to go on other holidays don't think the food is as good they have a show which is the staff who I must say works hard if you go as large group advise to book,,
Great atmosphere. Food and wine slightly more expensive than other places but with the added benefit of fun entertainment from the waiting staff and the cabaret finale. Very popular with families and those celebrating birthdays.,,
Very friendly and entertaining night out and very good food a great family restaurant worth a visit I went here in October with all the family the food was very good very generous portions the kids loved the entertainment but don't go here if you are after a quiet meal as this is a lively restaurant,,
"Went here twice last week.Great food,service and atmosphere.would highly recommend if in Paphos.Great for kids.xxxx",,
Very popular and you need to book. Wide menu options and service good and friendly. Entertainment on certain nights. Well worth a visit,,
My wife and I eat at fat mamas one night as the reviews on here and word of mouth at the hotel was very good. Overall this place deserves its 4 stars.,,
Loverly place and easy to find on Kings Road loverly people friendly helpful a can be lively at times but we'll worth a visit excellent food and reasonably priced,,
Everyone enjoyed their meal here .i ordered a spicy steak and chips which was nice. Only complaint was the side salad which seemed to just be put on the plate straight from the bag with little effort which was a shame as everything else was spot on !,,
Just amazing food and the staff here was such fun .. we came for the end of season Halloween party and it was brilliant,,
"We were told by others we had to visit and so we did. I found it to be a friendly place in a good location and there was entertainment but the food was not as good as other diners I have visited, and it is not cheap. I would not go back.",,
About 20 of us went for a group meal following a wedding in Cyprus. Bit slow getting the first round in! Good food and massive portions!,,
Othwer wise a quirky atmosphere with well priced food and drinks. Would imagine kids of all ages would love it,,
"Attentive and good service...  Food pretty average...  Reasonable price...    I would describe this as a TGI Friday type of place, when they announce someone's birthday three dancing girls come out sing a song and do a dance in some pretty nifty costumes. They are actually quite good...there were 3 birthdays or claimed birthdays when we were there eating , not sure if it was the punters just wanting to see the girls on two occasions!    It's not a bad place the food was reasonable but not brilliant...my wife's salad was very good, sons chicken burger a bit soggy and my plate was ok...two puddings..the strawberry, ice cream and pancake was disappointing but my wife's fruit salad and ice cream was ok.    So all in all on the food front mixed...service was good and cheerful..they were doing face painting and also have a couple of people dressed up as cartoon characters for photos etc..so good place for families with young kids.",,
"We love this place, first visited in 2004 then 2014 and now in 2016!  Great service, huge portions, great dancing and singing, children entertained and our daughter loves it!  Will be a final dinner outing of our holiday again as in 2014!  Keep up the good work Fat Mama's",,
"A great night & massive portions! This lively, welcoming restaurant has impromptu dancing entertainment & the kids loved it! The food was lovely, the ribs were as soft as butter, the fajitas were spicy & flavoursome... the desserts were huge & a wide choice ... A definite place to spend your birthday",,
"The atmosphere and food are great here. They have a good choice of food, prices are reasonable, and the food is always delicious xx. We always visit a few times when in Paphos, it's a firm favourite. They do a cabaret show with singing and dancing each night which is entertaining",,
"A friendly welcome and attentive service throughout, mad a nice meal all the better. The staff were great with the kids and the buy one get one free drinks was a nice surprise. The food portions were very good and made up in size what they may have lacked in finesse.  We were hoping to see the characters for the children, but were told the entertainment didn't start until 7.30pm. We dragged out the dinner to keep the kids going, but after a Britney Spears(!) number, it seemed to peter out so we paid and left without the kids seeing Fat Mama or Cowboy Willy...a slight downer on an otherwise lovely evening. Would recommend the place, but worth bearing in mind the timings if you want the entertainment too.",,
"Good food, my husband had the steak fajitas which was a huge portion and I had the pizza. Really loud with a cabaret that lasted about 10 mins. A bit cringy and a bit forced. The staff were friendly enough until there faces dropped as soon as they left your table.  Would return but through the day to have your food in peace.",,
Go here!! It's amazing the choice is massive and it may take you a couple of drinks to decide what to have which can't be a bad thing. We really enjoyed our meals and my daughter managed to gave dessert which was also lovely. Staff are lovely and for the quantity of food you get the prices are very reasonable. Very happy.,,
"We heard so many good things about this place, we were really excited to check it out. The waiters were really friendly and the service was very quick, but the food was horrible. We ordered the large portion of ribs to share and it came out in less than five minutes.... which meant it had obviously just been microwaved or reheated. We could only eat one or two before deciding to leave. The two for one cocktails are great value but our mojitos tasted like rum and lime cordial. I'm not a food snob and I've loved a lot of the restaurants in Pafos, I just wouldn't come here again. We left very sad and still hungry :(",,
Nice food and large portions. Staff are all very helpful and overall experience was great. The Entertainment left a little to be desired but we didn't visit the restaurant for that!,,
We visited in may this year and returned back with different friends in october! We were early so got 2 for 1 cocktails! Ordered food! Starter was lovely! But main wasnt as good as last time was very greasy was quite disapointed and my partner had the steak which he wasnt overly happy with either! They were maybe just having an off night! Was ashame,,
"Looked a bit gimicky from the street but the food & value were VERY good. Well worth a visit, especially if you have youngsters.",,
Very popular restaurant. We didnt have to queue as we arrived just after the restaurant opened but queues were there when we left around a hour later.    Food was lovely. We all enjoyed the food.    American style diner food with large portions.    Slightly pricey but food was good.,,
Ate here last week. Meal was expensive but large portions. I ordered 24 spare ribs in hot sauce but came in normal barbecue sauce with tiny jug of hot sauce. I think was an accident. Meal was still very nice but over priced.,,
"Nice meal - starters of stuffed mushrooms and nachos! Big portion of nachos but tasty! Mains - halloumi fajitas and fillet steak! Fajitas were very tasty lots of nice veg. Steak was also a very good piece (went for large option) - being totally honest it was a bit overcooked, medium when I asked for medium/rare but as it was decent quality I didn't contemplate sending it back! Then to top it off 3 girls confidently performed a 20 minute cabaret show! Well done ladies, especially the last dance!",,
Lovely food . We are going back tonight for our last evening meal thoroughly reccommend the ribs . Huge portions of lovelyness,,
"Last night we went to fat mama's for dinner and was not disappointed. Service was quick and friendly but not to quick that you felt rushed at anytime. Garlic bread arrived in time for us to enjoy the show and was lovely start to any meal .    The burgers are the best in the whole of Paphos and they just melt in your mouth with every bite , and the ribs are on another planet the meat just falls of the bones which makes them a joy to eat so juicy and succulent with every taste.    Drinks are a very reasonable price to suitable for any budget. Can't wait to return as it is a must to anyone visiting Paphos on holiday",,
Popped out to Fat Mama's early on Tuesday evening and it was good that I went early because there was a constant queue of people wanting a table. Food and service were outstanding. Entertainment was also very good. Struggled to finish my pudding.,,
"Food was excellent , my wife had a small pasta and was enough for both is us ! Waitress did recommend a small , a large would have fed a family . If was someone's birthday then the girl dancers embarrass them in a very good spirit . Well worth visiting for fund & friendly staff",,
food was great and plenty of it. not a huge choice and if you are looking for local food then this is not the place and mainly american,,
"I have visited Fat Mama's on three occasions now. First time in September 2015-great food, great service and great entertainment. Second visit first week in October 2016- again great service, great food and great entertainment. Third visit was the second week in October 2016- I was disappointed on this visit having such high expectations following my first 2 visits, the waitress let us down and didn't seem as friendly or on the ball and the food did not seem as good! However, the entertainment was still good. I will not let this visit put me off from visiting if I holiday in Paphos in the future and will just put this down to a 'one off'. Overall great place to visit whilst in Paphos especially if your celebrating something special as they do put on a good show for you.",,
"Decided to give this place a try, after seeing how busy it was and glad we did! If home made, freshly prepared and cooked burgers is your fancy, then this is the place for you! Great food, service and atmosphere's to be had at Fat Mamma's. Loved our visit here and will definately be back again, when we finally work off the huge portions served :-)",,
One of the best steaks I've had (apart from my mum's!) - a little slow service but that's because it's very busy. Lovely wine - nice and dry. Very friendly staff. Plenty larger portion sizes. Surprised no Keo tonight but good alternatives. Would definitely visit again if in the area or as near as we are now.,,
Went to fat mama's after reading reviews. Went as a family of four wife son & his girlfriend . The food was fab massive plate of food staff were really great quick service would go back again . Great time 😋😋,,
"We saw this queue outside of Fat Mamas ,had a look and browse ,then continued to walk past,to find nothing that would compare in Menu Choice,prices and by the looks popularity,needless to say we end up revisiting the place before the end of our holiday,we would definitely go back next time round .",,
This place is amazing - Atmosphere is amazing food is amazing staff are amazing value is amazing - If i had the money i would fly here every weekend for my dinner.,,
"I visit Fat Mam's every time we are in Paphos.  The food and drink are cheap and also fantastic quality. The dishes are huge, and I can never finish my meal.  The staff are really friendly and attentive.  They also have entertainment which is great and brings a great atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back :)",,
"We ate here once and loved it - food was yummy, portions are massive though. I asked for a small portion and still couldn't finish it (and believe me, I can eat) but this isn't a bad thing - why would you complain about too much?? The service was quick and attentive, if lacking slightly in friendliness/interaction, but understandable as it was very, very busy. We pitched up about 9pm and were lucky to get a table, we didn't have to wait too long but would have understood even if we did as we didn't book and it was Friday night!  Entertainment is great too, dancers were brilliant and it wasn't all old greek stuff which was a good mix.",,
Decided to head out to Fat Mama's for a meal one night. We wanted to go early before it got busy and you can book a table before 7pm by email. You also get a 10% discount if you are there before a certain time  We got a nice table and they had some special offers on like buy 1 get 1 free on large fizzy juices.  There are 2 menus to choose from and so much selection. We decided to go for the ribs for starters and glad we shared them.  For the main course we both went for the burgers and what a plateful you get. The food was very nice and hot.  If you want a fun night out they do entertainment later on in the evening while you eat.  You can catch the 615 bus from paphos harbour or coral bay and get off at the stop beside McDonalds. There is a return bus stop right across the road.  It started to get a bit busier before,,
"great food, vey large plates , lots of singing through the meal, all bit noisy for us. great place for family with kids tht have a big appetite",,
The food was good but there were delays between each course and getting the bill took a long time. We noticed each time we visited to enquire we were stood waiting for a while although staff looked free. Entertainment was good.,,
"The food and service was excellent, they also put on a dancing show. We got engaged while we was in paphos and the restaurant gave us champange to celebrate.",,
"A lot of the staff spoke English but the rest of the staff were lovely too,the food well I asked for a small portion but I still couldn't eat it all,lovely food,my fiancé had the massive burger which he said was great,can't fault the place at all,I did find the entertainment abit cheesy but each to there own and everybody else seemed to enjoy it,will defiantly be going again next year when I go Cyprus again.",,
Excellent food and atmosphere. Staff could not be more friendly and food was cooked to perfection. A must for all people visiting paphos.,,
If you want a romantic meal for 2 then go somewhere else but if you are with children or a crowd of friends this is a great place to eat. Ribs are very tasty and the staff are well trained to deliver a good dining out experience. I have been eating there for many years and there is always a queue at the entrance which says a lot for the restaurant.,,
"Were recommended to eat here for food and entertainment but entertainment not before 9pm, a little pricey but portions good. Won't be back during holiday.",,
"My family have been here several times, everytime they are in Cyprus they visit Fat Mama's. I decided to hold my hen do here which was organised by one of my bridesmaids. Fat Mamas is the place to go if you are celebrating something in Cyprus, the staff will go all out to make you feel special and to celebrate with you. My friend had a lot of decoration which they allowed her to put up and organise with no trouble at all. The food is amazing, the portions are so large! The spurts of singing and dancing were great entertainment and kept the children entertained, even allowing them to join in. A must when in Paphos.",,
"Very attentive staff but were obviously primed to make a fast turnover of clients. The ""entertainment"" that accompanied our meal went over our heads and the drinks were the most expensive of the holiday. The food was a good class of fast food stuff, burgers, pizzas and ribs ( very good). Not for us but was very popular and there was a queue when we past so there were doing something right.",,
"Heard good things about this place from trip advisor & seeing that it was only over the road we gave it a go early in the holiday.  There was a short que with about a 15min wait but we could watch the show they put on so we didn't mind at all.  There was a very good reason for the que too as the food was awesome & the service was amazing aswel, Megan served us and she made us feel welcome and we didn't feel rushed or anything.  Try the Fat Momma portions if you're a big eater, you won't be disappointed!  10/10",,
"Everyone has heard of Fat Mama's and its reputation for gods food and huge portions....we weren't disappointed.  We arrived to a small queue (Be Prepared for this or phone and book a table) This was the only let down of the night as the guy at Front of House didn't have a clue as to what tables he had spare for the number and size of diner groups arriving-we waited half an hour to be sat at table that was free the whole time we waited!!)  However once seated the service improved no end. The server (an ex-pat) was polite and efficient. Our food and drink order was placed and served in a reasonable amount of time. The portions are huge, I had the Rack of Ribs (it was like a seen out of the Flintstones ) Lynne had the Burritos, we failed to finish so took the rest back to the apartment in 'Doggy Bags' (Dinner sorted for the next day )  There is a show towards the end of the evening which is Very Cheesy but good fun.  I would highly recommend Fat Mama's for a Blow Out-you are on holiday after all",,
"A young couple staying in our All Inclusive Hotel went I to Fat Mamas and really enjoyed it, so give it a try, we didn't as we were only there for a week but they were here for Two",,
"We went as a family recently, and visited this restaurant twice as the food was so yummy! I ordered the small ribs and got a plate full! Just for €10 doesn't come with sides, but does come with a plate of chips, what a bargain! And they were gorgeous, just fell off the bone! Other other meals I saw come out were equally delicious and huge!    They have ladies changing costumes and dancing/singing to keep you entertained, and someone else who paints nails, so great place to keep kids entertained? It was my birthday so they bought a free drink out singing happy birthday to me!    Don't miss it, it's great value, I would expect to more for such quality food! Missing the place already haha",,
"Not the best food in the world, but decent burgers, wings, ribs and other American type food. What this place does have is a great atmosphere with plenty happening around you. The portions are massive so careful how much you order! The children & the big kids(dads) love this place.",,
"Fat Mama's serve excellent steaks in an innovative Tex-Mex style. It is actually very good. When we were there they had a music and dance show to keep us entertained.    Open air tables are best. The place has an informal style, jeans and shorts are ok.    I would go again.",,
"Second visit in 2 years, great place to eat with entertainment thrown in. Good staff and the food is excellent.",,
"e ate here quite late one evening, there was us and another couple, the food was hot and quick to come out, however the nachos were a bit soggy, the fajitas were a bit lacking in meat and my burger was so huge i couldn't really eat it properly, the burger itself was lovely meat, but does it need to have all that stuff on it ?    waitress we called her helga as she was a bit scary but service was good",,
every time we travel to Cyprus we visit this place. amazing food huge portions. must try the ribs! go with a empty stomach. steaks are also fab. can get busy in high season.,,
"We visited Fat Mamas twice in the week that we spent in Paphos and considering that we were all inclusive this should speak volumes about this restaurant!.. On our first visit we booked and the second just turned up and luckily we didn't have to wait as there is usually a queue!.. The service is always good and you're never left waiting for long.. The menu is American/Italian and very varied including a vegatarian collection .. The meals are always enjoyable and delicious but the thing that makes this restaurant special is the singing and dancing especially for celebrating customers .. Birthdays , weddings etc .. Great entertainment while you enjoy a wonderful meal! Thanks Al and your team !xx",,
"Every time we passed there was a queue to get in so thought it must be good! It was, the food was wonderful, the service was great and exceptional value for money. I don't think they need the entertainment though, it's a bit cheesy, but this place is definitely worth a visit",,
"We ended up in here for dinner and it's probably not somewhere we would return to as the food was about average (however we only tried 2 things on the menu!) There are many better places to eat further down in the harbour. However......the staff were very friendly and the waitress who served us was honest about the dishes and the portion sizes which was very much appreciated and made sure we didn't over order. The portions are HUGE so you won't need more than 1 course! There was about 15 minutes of entertainment from ""fat mamas dancers"" which was extremely cringe and tacky but provided something to watch. The place was very busy. Overall I would say this was the cheapest meal we have had. 2 drinks, 2 large portions of food €20. Worth having a look if you're not too fussed about quality taste!",,
"Waitied 45 minutes for service in this place... Music far to loud, dancers really have no clue at all. Seen far better further down the strip.. Staff were OK but some very stroppy and moody, When food was served most of it was still frozen and raw. Complained to management who did nothing about it but offer the kids a free juice. We won't be returning....",,
"This place was fantastic, the food was filling and the entertainment spot on... they get all visitors involved and can surprise you with a drop of a hat... good fun!!!",,
"Lovely place to eat, food good, staff lovely, entertainment not bad, we ate here nearly every other night because there was nowhere else really nice",,
"Visited here during our visit to Paphos, very typical italian /american. Huge portions from large menu, however they do offer 2 sizes on some of the meals which was ideal for me.Nice touch is the entertainment provided during the meal. Worth a visit.",,
"Went here one night looking for something a bit different. Bit pricey however you do get big portions.  Bit disappointed with the nachos (on the vegetarian menu). Massive plate full but no sign of jalepenos or guacamole. Nachos are supposed to be spicy, these were very bland. Pizza was very nice tho and I had the small one which was more than enough!  Would go back although I'm sure there are better places which are also much cheaper.",,
"Never can really complain about this restaurant. Over the years the portion size has got smaller over the last few years but that isn't a bad thing. They are still big.    The pizza, burger, pasta and steak are all great and worth a visit in themselves.    The entertainment is great fun, all the entertainers look like the are having the time of their lives.    Will definitely return again!",,
Lots and lots of food! Portions are grotesquely large. Entertainment is a bit tacky and the cocktails could strip paint off the walls!,,
"As a family of 4, we ate here a couple of times and on both occasions, the food was lovely. Weren't so keen on the entertainment at all, but others seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. Staff were lovely and service was quick. Decent prices, would eat here again.",,
"we stumbled across Fat Mamma,s and it is ijust fabby,the food,the service,the drinks the staff and the entertainment was amaising.we visited on 5 different nights and all were just fantastic,not a one off,all the staff put there all into making this a great place to visit.",,
"You cannot go to Paphos without dining at Fat Mamas. The welcome is always the same...... friendly. The staff treat the diners with entertainment. The food is very good and reasonably priced. Steaks are really good, large portions.  Yes its a tourist attraction, but why not ? Your on holiday! Kids love it!",,
"Never been before in all the previous 4 visits to Paphos,but decided to give it a go this year and ended up going twice.Staff were attentive and polite,food and drinks reasonably priced,entertainment enjoyable.All in all would highly recommend.Really enjoyed both visits",,
"Excellent food, good entertainment and service the price was reasonable, a very enjoyable evening. Thank you",,
A tourist trap which is somewhat overrated. Both the food and service is average and overpriced. The 'singers' are fun but Fat Mama and Willy need to have new costumes !,,
Lovely food just starve yourself before eating 😀😀 steak was like years ago perfect to your taste yum,,
"Went here for the 1st time a couple of weeks ago, and absolutely loved it. The steak was amazing, so tender and tasty. Only chose the small option as I had been advised they were quite big portions, and I couldn't even finish the small one!!!  Went again the following week to meet up with friends, and again it was lovely. I ordered a jacket potato instead of chips the 2nd time and it was one of the best jacket potato's I have ever had :) Our waitress (Marie) was lovely as well, nothing was too much trouble for her. Also enjoyed the free entertainment. Would visit again if I am back in the area.",,
Portions were VERY large and good value but if you are looking for something local don't bother! Lots of kids running around especially when the face painter arrived.,,
Heard good things about this place so arrived and was given a table for 2 within a few minutes without booking at about 8pm on a Friday night.  The place was almost full and had a good mix of young and mature couples together with families with young Children.    I had a steak with a Diane sauce for 24euros which was nice and tasty in itself but was served with frozen thin chips and salad which looked like it had just been emptied from a UK supermarket mixed salad bag.....think Asda.    The place has it's own entertainment to keep your mind away from your very average meal and the three young ladies do a great job of dancing and singing which perhaps explains why you pay a premium price for a meal you will not want to repeat.,,
Thought we were going to Willis ribshack but found out all the same. HUGE portions. Which I hadn't had a starter. My husband had a large portion of ribs which was 24 ribs !!!!! I had fajitas which were ok but steak a bit tough. A little bit of entertainment ! The waitress we had was very smiley jolly and lovely .,,
"Im sure this place is right for a certain type of clientele, those on a budget with lots of kids who are in Greece but want English fast food like ribs and burgers - seasoned travellers!!!! It was our first night in the area and fell across this place and unfortunately decided to eat here as we hadn't, at that stage seen the smaller places just along the road. The service was quick, the plates over flowing but it was like visiting a down market TGI Fridays, if thats what you want then Im sure it is fine but we were in Cyprus and wanted to experience Cypriot cuisine so this place was not for us",,
I've been coming here for over 20 years and it never disappoints. You may have a little wait for a table but the wait is well worth it.,,
"brilliant as always, booked a table for 16 of us at very short notice the day before visiting. The food was amazing and humongously portioned. The staff worked really hard to make sure everyone was happy and catered for and the girls sang happy birthday to my hubby with a feather hat on him :-)",,
Went to this place after having it recommended.Went early as it opens at 5pm and later it gets busy.Food was fantastic.Only thing I would say is make sure you are really hungry before you go.Huge portions.The service from the staff is exceptional.Very attentive and friendly and really look after customers.It's a must visit if you are in Paphos.,,
We only went here once the good was fabulous you need to go early to get a seat there is entertainment at night 1 portion would suit 2 of you excellent service on the main road couple of mins walk,,
"Lots of people have said this place served good food & the portions were large but I didn't find neither. Yes it's popular, as the queues proved. We were having our last meal before catching our flight home & if we return I may return here. Food was cooked fine but it was just all chucked on one plate.",,
We ate here on our last night as we noticed it was constantly busy and I must say the food was amazing. The staff were brilliant and the prices were fab. I only wish we had eaten here sooner as I would have definitely been back more than once. The food was mainly American but there was so much choice it was hard to decide! There was evening entertainment and it had a very modern feel. Definitely recommend eating here it was gorgeous!!!,,
"If you are looking for that quiet romantic secluded corner you wont find it here. This is a fun packed dinner for all the family. Berger's, Ribs, Steaks its got the lot.",,
does what it says on the menu .. no arty farty stuff ..just damn good steak ... with what it says no added bits of greenery haha,,
"Omg we ate here, excellent food but remember to order a small portion as sizes are unreal ! Great staff and entertainment, everybody has to eat here if coming to Paphos !!!!",,
Went for a meal here as always good food good service and entertainment. We last visited 5 years ago and were not dissaponted on our return would recommend. The added bonus of dancing girls is a nice touch.,,
"Top top restaurant in Cyprus. Forget Sissifos Steak House, fillet steak in pepper sauce at mamas knocks the socks of it. In fact it would definitely be in the top 3 best steaks I've ever had. Among the table we had a fillet steak a burger chicken fajitas and a chicken in tomato and chilli sauce o and we had garlic bread to start which we shared between us which was more than enough to feed four, all of which was of exceptional quality and very very tasty. We will defiantly be returning here for a feed before our holiday is over. Was drinking John smiths Heineken and wood pecker amongst us and the bill was 80 euro. Top place. Just try it. The staff all very pleasant and there still dancing just like they were the last time I visited 7 years ago. Keep up the good work and food quality.",,
Huge portions but low quality. This looked constantly busy but was not impressed. We had pizza (base was a bit raw) and bbq Hunter's chicken. The entertainment was some dancers who flew in and flew out. Other stuff during the day for families like nail painting.,,
"Visited here as whenever we drove past it always seemed very busy. As it was, when we arrived we had to queue on the street. The man at front of house (Paul) was very friendly, and chatted to everyone. We had a short wait in the bar area, which wasn't a problem. However, we were very disappointed with the food. 2 of us had burgers, and 2 of us had ribs. It all tasted rather bland, processed and microwaved. Not a patch on the homemade food we have had in other restaurants in Cyprus. Entertainment was good, but the food let the place down.",,
"The food and entertainment was excellent. Best burgers in the world, seriously! This place is a must visit when u are in Paphos",,
"We were staying at The Elysium , so this place was just down the road. The taxi driver from the airport recommended it. As soon as we realised it was also an American ribs place as well as an Italian - we should made our escape! We both ordered lasagne - thinking we couldn't go wrong. It was really awful . First mouthful was lumps of gristle so I left it all. We paid bill and left. There are so many good places to eat , I would give this one a miss!",,
Loud and cheap entertainment.  Food was well portioned and had a good menu.  Staff dont know how to handle being busy. Had to wait almost an hour for my bill and askinh 3 people.  Then to find out there is a discount if you pay by cash and not card.  Disappointing,,
"We went to the highly recommended Fat Mamas and we were not disappointed.  Maria our waitress was jolly and fun and game for a bit of leg pulling. Food was of a very high standard with excellent size portions and 2 menus giving a massive selection. The price wasn't cheap but fair for the size and the quality of the food.  If any slight criticism is that the beer could have done with being colder.  In all a great night,great fun and great food.  Will defiantly return.",,
"Wow! Fat mamas is the best restaurant in paphos. The food is amazing, we had a starter and a main and let me tell you i couldn't finish the main as it was so big, fajitas i had by the way. Staff are lovely and accommodating. Cocktails are fab too. They celebrate special occasions and have dancers/singers coming round so the entertainment is great too. We had young children with us and they loved it too.",,
Very busy and staff sure to let us know of any delays with our orders due to volume of customers. Without hovering over our table staff made sure we were satisfied with our meals and responded to any requests promptly. Good night out.,,
"Went here for evening meal and was treated to fantastic friendly and efficient service. Beautiful food and enormous portion sizes, There was also entertainment on which was very good very reasonably priced.",,
Pleasent evening food of high standard very popular hence queing book in advance kids will love it prices a little higher than most other eating houses but still good for a treat or special occasion i allways go self catering but always eat out in evening so i have tried a few still think good night and worth a go,,
Overpriced food The steak I had was very gritty The pizza my wife was guwjuss But the entertainment was very poor and cringy,,
We went here last year as it was highly recommended. Last year me and my partner loved it and the food was great. This year we took friends and although the entertainment was still good it had turned into a TGI's where they sang happy birthday and congratulated engagements so it was mega cheesorama. We had the sharing platter and the portion was perfect but the potato skins were still hard. My friends chicken burger was very dry and chargrilled. He said the burnt taste took over all the other flavours. We still enjoyed ourselves but won't rush back next time we are in Paphos.,,
"OMG what can I say, absolutely outstanding meal the service/friendliness of all the staff was excellent. We were a family of 4 who all ate different and each meal was exceptional. The steak fajitas were amazing best by far. Definitely be returning before our holiday ends. Good value for money.Little gem of Paphos. Definitely give it a try if you have not been",,
"Open for breakfast dinner and lunch as attached to the hotel apartment next door is this modern clean and thanks to air con a cool place to eat.    Their is a revolving range of foods with themes on each different day eg carvery, Oriental, international etc. Mostly the food is geared to British tastes but their is also Greek/Cypriot variations each night. Eg your Tahini, Hummus, Taramasalata and olive oil based dressings. Look out for the Cyprus corner.    Desserts have fresh fruits, jellies, blamanhr? Creme caramel and cakes.    Prices look to be extremely competitive compared to surrounding venues.",,
"Great atmosphere, massive portion sizes and great tasting food. Had the peppered steak which was the steak I had been expecting at Moorings. Absolutely delicious. Ooh and half the wife's ribs that she could not manage. For sweet 3 of us shared a chocolate cake.",,
"I'll start with the positive. The young female waitress who seated us and took out order is their best member of staff by far. I didnt catch her name but she was so helpful and friendly she also had a quick chat with us when she came to our table later in the evening too.    The food portions are huge!! And quite tasty!    Although it's a bar with a variety of entertainment, personally it's too much too often. There should singing, dancing, congratulations and a few more. There is too much going on and it distracts you from the meal.  It was particularly busy when we went and it looked like the servers that were working were too busy, people were queuing to come in which we thought was a good sign.    Asking for the bill was an absolute nightmare! It took the best part of an hour to get it. We originally asked the waiter in the black no.23 shirt for our bill. 20 minutes later we still didn't have it but the tables that asked him after us had been given theirs. So we waited a little bit longer. It was like being ignored all of a sudden nobody came to the corner where we were sat. There was another waiter in black no.20 cleaning and setting a table up for the next day a few tables over. So I said to him we were still waiting and wanted our bill. This was half an hour later. Eventually when we finally got our bill it was plonked on the table and he walked off. Looked at our bill to find that it said cash only which we were a bit confused about. But again there was nobody around to ask. Eventually somebody came over to the table behind so we asked her. And she says because of a deal on cocktails it's a cash only meal and if we want to pay by card the discount is taken off. This would have all been okay had we been told this at the time of ordering our drinks.  When we finally left we were thoroughly annoyed and we will not be returning or recommending.",,
"We visited here on my birthday and really enjoyed it! It has a really good atmosphere with entertainment, lovely food and big portions! We were glad we booked as people were queuing to get a table, very popular! Would definitely recommend!",,
Staff friendly and service very good. Food excellent and have been here on several occasions and it's always a very good night indeed. Highly recommended.,,
A very good experience here both food and entertainment were excellent. Food was very tasty and huge portion size. Service was also very good.,,
lovely food good for kids good variety and reasonably priced. came with a table of 11 and food came out very quickly was really pleased.,,
"We visited twice in our 2-week stay in the area. Both times the food was well-cooked, well-presented and prompt. The cuisine on offer includes pizzas, pasta and steak - nothing traditionally Cypriot at all.    The service is friendly and as quick as possible, but the venue gets very busy from around 7pm each evening. You can book a table, to avoid waiting in line, but once seated the orders are taken quickly and the food arrives without too much of a wait.    Here at Fat Mama's they celebrate special occasions by singing to the table celebrating at certain times of night Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy will appear to entertain the kids.    A fun night out with great food. The portions are big, so go easy on the starters if you're looking to fit in a pudding! We saw many people leave with take-out boxes of their leftovers!",,
"We went with our family as we had been recommended. We were not disappointed, the food was a mix of American / Italian and was well cooked and presented. It was a great hit with our 8 yr grandaughter who also enjoyed the great atmosphere. This restaurant is certainly worth a visit.",,
"We last visited Paphos 11 years ago and couldn't believe Fat Mamas was still there, and still as busy as it was back then!  As they like to make a fuss over personal celebrations the last time we visited they said they'd get the team to sing....it never happened.  So this time we arrived in Paphos on the Wednesday, and on our stroll out we booked a table for Saturday evening and were told they had a show on. Again, they asked if there were any celebrations (we had a joint birthday celebration), this was noted on our reservation.  Saturday came and the queue was at least 6 families deep so we made our way to the front as we had a reservation. The waiter came and we pointed out our booking and he actually asked if we'd just written it in the book as some people do this!!!!  Anyway, the food service could have been a little faster although the food was really tasty.  The show started.....3 girls from Manchester!! Just what you want to see when you've gone all the way to Cyprus, it was just ok.  In previous years the staff have come out dressed up with coloured wigs on, banging dustbin lids and really getting everybody in a great mood! But, not this time.  Again, the birthdays were not acknowledged despite it being written on our booking and us also mentioning it when ordering!    It was spacious, tasty enough food, service could have been better.....but I'm just not sure what all the hype is about!    We just visited the once and I'm afraid to say that was enough. I wouldn't even say go for the experience as there wasn't real one to be had!",,
"Being early we were able to obtain a table. Otherwise if you don't want to que book.  Lots of service staff, drinks order (2drinks) could have been slightly quicker in delivery.  We then got the attention of a member to order our meal. This arrived approx 30 mins and very good portions which is I think is what Fat Mammas is renowned for. I had Hunters chicken and being honest the B B Q sauce was missing the B B Q taste in fact quiet bland and runny. The other meal ok. Atmosphere was good and they do try a little entertainment more than the majority of hostelry's.  Personally wouldn't rush back.",,
The staff was really friendly but the food was horrible. I couldn't even finish it and me and my friends weren't feeling very good after that. Go for a drink not for food.,,
"We had a lovely night here, food was lovely and plentiful. Service was very slow to take food and drink orders. Plus we had to queue about 30 minutes to get in then told to go round the side to bar and wait for table there where this was very busy and packed!    The night was made when stavros flatley and son arrived and performed in front of everyone and got all dancing.    Food was pricey but at least it was nice and lots of it.    Worth a visit but not very Cypriot more American. We only went as our 16 yr old daughter wanted to go there to celebrate her GCSEs.",,
Great if you want rubbish food with loud music. It's Brash and pretty rubbish but I suppose if you have young kids they would love it.,,
"Visited Fat Mama's on others who had gone.  Long lines of people waiting to get seated is a good sign, Usually...  Waited over 45 mins to get in and seated, but that's because it's a busy place.  Ordered nachos to start, which were ok 5/10 but big portion so be warned.  I ordered ribs (large) and my wife ordered Fajitas.  Mine was bland so only ate half of it and I'm a big eater and love my food but this was below average.  My wife's was so salty she had a mouthful and left it.  We complained about the levels of salt to staff and eventually manager who after some debate removed it from the bill and rightly so.  All in all I can see why people visit here so much, big portions will always bring people in, and lots of grilled meat does the same.  Would we go back????  Probably not, but maybe we caught them on an off night.  Highlight of night was a live performance from none other than Stavros Flatley & his son. (BGT finalists) quality.",,
"Very disappointing to be writing this. Caught a bus especially to visit here after eating here 3 years ago and loved it, excellent food, and the elderly waiter was so welcoming with a free aperitif at the end.  Sadly this year was not the same, all looked promising on arrival with a long queue which took us 20 minutes to be seated despite lots of surrounding restaurants, we werent put off, we thought great it must still be amazing.  After we were finally seated we perused the menu and waited 15 minutes for our drinks order to be taken, then waited another 20 minutes before getting up and getting a waitress to order food. Food didnt tak too long to arrive and as before the portions were absolutely enormous-great, or not so great i ordered the lasagne, but it was so creamy (not in a good way) i only ate about a third as i felt like i was going to be sick, signalled my husband who rushed off to get the bill as i was getting very queasy by now.  Service time was terrible, although the some of the waitresses themselves were lovely, some notso as well though. Music far too loud, couldnt have a conversation over dinner, entertainment very samey too. probably ok as somewhere to take kids for a meal, but really wouldnt come back again and cant understand what everyones raving about?",,
Before 7 pm you should book a table after this time people are queuing along the pavement.  Table for 4 a few drinks and a meal cost 136 euro's witch is not bad .  But every one said you must have the ribs.  one had ribs the rest had fillet steak.  I don't know what animal the steak came from but it was not Beef but it was quite nice  The ribs got sent back they were cooked in a microwave in there plastic packet then just tipped on the plate.  Entertainment was 3 dancers lasted about 3o mins not very good  sorry would not eat there again,,
Where to start- waited for 10 mins to the seated despite most if not all of the tables being empty at 6.45. Lots of staff but they seem more preoccupied with having a chat with each other. Food poor. Our waitress was polite but when she asked if everything was ok and our answer was not complementary she was uninterested. The entertainment was good but that's all your paying for. Cocktails have no resemblance to what you order- they all taste the same!,,
"Lovely restaurant, lively entertainment, I always go for the small portion sizes as they are big. Will always return to this pace on every visit.",,
Great place for food beer and great entertainment . Great service make that you wanna come back there more and more. My favorite are Sheriff Ribs :-),,
"Food is good and loads of it. Entertainment is cheesy but keeps the kids amused. Definetly worth a visit, always busy.",,
Read so many good things about this place but disappointed with both the quality of food and the entertainment provided would not rush to go back,,
Very popular and I am see why. Food is good and they provide entertainment from 8 pm . Everyone enjoyed their meals kids included. Swift and efficient service,,
what a great restaurant this is the food is amazing & plentiful the girls that do the entertainment are brill,,
Waited two hours for very poor meal service for drinks impossible steak over cooked burgers like cardboard would not recomend,,
"Fat mamas stands out partly because of its huge sign on the high street but also because it's always busy - a good sign they're doing something right. We called in to see what he attraction was. They have two menus (one for fat mamas and another for Willys rib shack) which give you a lot of choice if you're not sure what takes your fancy. They cater for kids and the entertainment was good fun. The old mans face on the front table during the can can was worth the visit alone :) not cheap, but worth it. They take pounds sterling too if you're running short on euros. Would highly recommend.",,
Great food for people with large appetites. It is very busy all the time with a amusing entertainment. The food is TexMex. I had the small rack of ribs which was enough for feed 3 people. Service was excellent and price was good. Great for the kids.,,
Well this was our favourite place to eat in Paphos. The menu suited all 7 of us which was a bonus. The portions were huge and really reasonably priced . The entertainment was fab . Would recommend fat mamas to anyone that visits Paphos,,
The food is amazing and at a very reasonably priced! Very helpful and polite staff! They put on some entertainment too which is good! 100% recommend :),,
"This was our second time back to Paphos and we knew we had to visit Fat Mamas again! I booked online a month before our holiday because it gets so busy people are literally queuing up the street! The food portions are HUGE and great value for money! The steak is the best I've had! There's live entertainment throughout the evening too, and if it's a special occasion, make sure you tell your waiter/waitress for a special surprise too!!! We will definitely be back next time, and we will recommend to friends and family visiting too!!",,
"Where do I start.... Warm beer, bad service awful entertainment and food average at best. There are much better restaurants close by. I honestly cannot understand why this place is so popular.",,
"We had been recommended to visit Fat Mamas before leaving for Cyprus. We noticed whilst passing just how popular it was with the queue of people waiting to be seated. We booked a table to beat the queues, we could only book a table between 5 - 7pm but that was fine for us. WOW is how we would describe the food, service and the cocktails. Would definitely visit again.",,
"Visited fat mamas during recent visit to Paphos , having been before we knew what to expect , Cabaret and the dressed up characters , this is a loud restaurant in a similar vein to Frankie and bennys and tgi Fridays , food is better than average and portion sizes are huge ! Like it says don't go if you want a quiet night , but if you want the food you can get at home then go for it , one word of caution you will be queuing to get a seat from 8pm",,
Went here on 11th August for my birthday with my family and even though we booked we still had to wait in the queue. We were sat down quite quickly though. Staff were nice and the entertainment of watching the 4 girls do a little dance and a costume change for every celebration was a little tiring after a while when we realised this was the ONLY entertainment. 2 characters dressed up for a photo and had a little dance. My daughter had her nails done to the tune of €10. The food was good but nothing special compared to other meals we had on the same strip. I did see on other nights that thy had other entertainment on so I was a little gutted my birthday wasn't as special as I thought it would be. Prices are quite reasonable. Italian and American menu.,,
"We were recommended by someone in our hotel to go to Fat Mammas, we went and it was a big mistake. This place is always full up so maybe it suits some people, but not us!    The full rack of ribs I had was good but they only came with chips or salad. There was no coleslaw or other similar to accompany the meal which is usual in Rib Shacks elsewhere. I like meat but it is just all about the meat. The burgers were also ok but again it was purely about the meat. I think this place is over priced and lacks variety on the plate for what you pay. Like meat and little else you'll love it, want something to go with your meat - don't go!",,
Even though the meal was lovely and large. 1 waitress spoilt it with her attitude and lack of customer service (must be working on commission),,
"When in Paphos, we went here twice. The first visit was fine, food ok, service good, entertainment very cheesy and my review would have been better had we not gone back. Service was awful despite the restaurant being less busy. It took 20 minutes for someone to take our order, another 30 minutes for it to arrive and one of the orders was wrong. We ordered a chicken burger and, despite questioning whether the order was correct and being assured it was, we were served a beef burger, however, having waited so long, we didn't want to have to wait for the correct meal so just ate the chips.",,
I liked the food but the staff and entertainment not so much. The staff seem to be quite young and not used to serving politely. The entertainment was a little OTT,,
"The food here is superb. When you've been once you will have to go again. Unless you have starved yourself or are a really big eater dont supersize as the portions are big. Had a fantastic steak then decided on a chocaholic pancake to share with my daughter, no chance of eating it all it was that big",,
"Visited on a Monday evening and was shocked we had to queue (this shows the popularity of the place!).    Queue was fairly long however we were seated within 10 minutes of waiting.    Staff were great, very friendly and helpful.    The food - oh my godddd the food was incredible. Both me and my boyfriend had the burger with bacon and cheese and I can honestly say it is one of the best meals I've ever had. For the price (somewhere around 11-12 euros) it is insanely good. The portions are massive of the chips and the burger is HUGE! I couldn't finish even half of my meal and was rather sad to have to leave it haha.    Thank you fat mamas, we loved the food drinks and entertainment and would definitely return here again!",,
"Been to this Italian/Western Restaurant blend a number of times over the last few years and must admit I will definitely be going again !!  Always busy, so best to go earlier rather than later to avoid disappointment of a long wait. However I will say they are very accommodating and have never had to wait longer than 20 mins and with a bar of their own have been more than happy to wait.  The food is fabulous. Each time I have visited I have tried different dishes ranging from pasta, pizza and burgers and each one was a success. One thing I will say about fat mama's is the food portions are ENORMOUS !!! You will not go hungry. Small portions and larger portions are available. I would always advise to go small as they are more than enough. Sharing starters could even fill the biggest of appetites. But hey for the very very reasonable prices and the option of doggy bags I would never complain!!  Not a restaurant for a quiet, candlelit meal as throughout the night bursts of performances, whether singing or dancing, are to be expected. A fun and entertaining twist.  Always a great atmosphere for a lively night and a hearty meal.  Would recommend to all those who visit Paphos!!",,
"Second year in a row visiting here for an evening meal. I would recommend pre booking as although they accept walk-ins-, they get busy and by 8pm they were full. We were a group of 13 aged 2, 10, teens and 40+  Great place to celebrate an occasion as the staff make a fuss of you and you may get a free drink!  Staff friendly and same ones as last year with a a bit of singing & dancing every 15-20 mins & a cabaret show later in the evening.  Food is excellent and varied. I would recommend the chicken al a rustica.  There are 2 menus to choose from and 2 portion sizes for most meals but beware- small meals are large and large are huge!  Very reasonably priced. Cost €100 inc drinks and starters for our individual group of 6.  High chair & kids menu with colouring crayons supplied and again portions are big for children. 1 meal would easily feed 2 under 8's.  Tip- all cocktails 2 for 1 earlier in the evening inc kids ones. We booked for 7pm and took advantage of this.  A must visit place if in southern Cyprus.",,
"There were queues at this place every night but after eating there i am unsure as to why. Service was shocking, food was average at best and it wasn't cheap. To top it all off the entertainment was right in front of our table and involved fire eating! the lovely taste of lighter fluid didn't help the food taste any better.",,
"We had to wait 15mins to be seated, the waitress came over to our table whilst we was ordering our meal she said that it would be around 20mins as they were busy, we got our drinks quite quickly, after 35mins of waiting I asked the waitress how long is our meal going to be, she said 5min, after 70mins I called the waitress over again and said that this is ridiculous I'm leaving after I have finished my drink, within 5mins our meal arrived 6 meals were under cooked 2 was ok but the salads was limped, we complained and was offered a complementary drink which we refused, we left in disgust.",,
"Paid a visit tonight to this restaurant after several recommendations from other holiday makers and also reviews online. I must say that this is a fabulous place.. Busy but a wait of only 15 mins .. There was a queue when we arrived at 7.30 but staff effectively seated people as soon as they could. Good portions of delicious food. Waitress named Cathy was more than helpful to sort out food for my daughter who has coeliac disease.. The head chef also has the same condition so understands fully. A great place to eat if you need to have gluten free options. Staff were all friendly and helpful, all greeted you with a smile. My daughter especially liked the young waiter who saw us to our table as he looked very much like Justin Bieber ❤️❤️ .. Try it out.. A very good night had by all. Many thanks ..",,
"What a place, the food portions were huge and the food was great. An American menu and an Italian menu, clearly not everything is fresh but it's still great food! The drinks are good with variety but the cocktails need work, they just look like a poor attempt at a cocktail. A little training would go a long way there. The staff are all friendly and know what there doing quite bubbly and chatty! However one small thing i would say, we were sat down buy a young ish lad with brown/blonde hair he was British. He swaggered over strutting around he looked like he cared more about his appearance and being noticed than actually doing his job which was sitting people down. Which again i would say needs improving. People waiting at the door to take a seat is great but no one was acknowledged before being sat down. A simple ""hi I'll be with you in a minute or just eating your table ready now"" goes a long way. All in all though I would return. The food and staff are good!",,
Fantastic friendly staff able to offer guidance in the menu which is either American or Italian and both were delicious! Book or go before 6:45 as it gets really busy. Portions are HUGE so go hungry!,,
"Over the years I've been going to Paphos, Cyprus I have visited Fat Mamas most years. The food is great, the entertainment is child friendly and they even have face painting outside too. My only gripe is you need to turn up earlier to avoid 20 minute + queues!",,
This seems to be a very popular place as people queue outside to get a table. The food is good although nothing extraordinary. They is some light entertainment during dinner on some nights and it's quite festive.,,
"Fat Mama lives up to its name! Massive portions ,there wasn't even room for dessert. Just be aware that it gets very busy after 7:30pm so do beware that there will be a wait if you go after, best to book. Otherwise lovely food and happy,cheerful staff. Entertainment with some dancing which was a great bit of entertainment. Hope to go again.",,
i didn't like the entertainment and noise that the environment has i prefer a nice and relaxing lovely place sorry but i didn't like the place the food not the best but ok a bit raw meat but not saying much :/,,
"Went to fat mamas 14 years ago and loved it then, took our kids as had told them about our visits before, they loved it and so did we. My dad and husband both had the large ribs...yes they are very large! Food still as good and atmosphere was great. Gets very busy so be prepared to wait If you arrive later in the evening, worth it though!",,
The food at fat mammas is delicious we loved it huge portions lovely staff and great dancers FYI entertain you you must go grey night lovely singer and dancer Cathy,,
"Fat Mama's is one of our 'go to' restaurants for a special night out. It's always lively and entertaining with special dance numbers performed by the crew. The kids always sit down in front and some can't because they are just itching to dance along and do. The food from both menus (Italian and American) are plentiful and satisfying. The BBQ ribs are impressive, the hamburgers and pasta are equally fine. The atmosphere is conducive for birthdays as well as weddings. It's a family restaurant, yet fun for couples, too. The bar is always full and the restaurant always crowded.",,
We went to fat mamas the second night we were here couldn't fault it food was exceptional most of the staff were friendly and very helpful would definitely recommend this restaurant 😀😎😁,,
"we were recommended this restaurant by jimmys jeep tours, excellent service and the food was amazing the steak which we have medium was perfect highly recommend this place",,
We walked in off the street to a very lively restaurant. We had a few minutes to wait so was sent to the bar where our tab was opened. All very relaxed. Meal was excellent and the service spot on.    We only realised it was a show restaurant when the cabaret girls came on. Short snips of song and dance. No way distracting and really good fun.  (Was handed a discount flyer for Jimmy's Jeep Tours with our receipt.),,
"Great meal out at Fat Mama's, huge portions and fast friendly service! Lovely food too. Big queues so book or get there early!!",,
"We went for a family meal after being recommended by the rep ,The long wait to get in and the popularity of the restaurant I was expecting good food and service .  We were served our starter within 10 minutes but we were kept waiting over a hour for our main and when it did arrive it was missing cheese on our cheeseburger the staff were apologetic and pleasant but the food was mediocre  Not worth the wait",,
"We visited Fat Mama's for our daughter's Birthday, and were very disappointed with the quality of the food. The portions were far too big and very stodgy. Although the service was good and the entertainment added a bit of fun to the night, we would not choose to go to Fat Mamma's again. For the prices they charge I'd expected a lot more.",,
"Went to Fat Mama's on 16th August 2016 and although quite late managed to get a seat and enjoy the hot sizzling food, and excellent entertainment.    What more can be said that already hasn't been said about Mama's. What I can say though, I have been to this restaurant 3 times previously since 2001 and it has never failed to provide excellent food and service at every visit, both as with the whole family (kids) and then as a couple.    A must night out in Paphos",,
"First night in Cyprus and we decided that we would visit an of favourite.    Staff were friendly and courteous, even move when our son fell a sleep moments after we had ordered, they brought out a pillow for him to rest his head on so he was more comfortable.    We kept our food order simple as we knew how big the food portions would be, but still had to leave some of it as it was too much for us without the little man helping us out.    Drinks were reasonably priced and we took full advantage of the 10% discount they had going if you paid in cash.    Would recommend Fat Mama's to anyone but would advised them to check with the staff on portion sizes as you could easily end up ordering too much food.",,
"This place is very lively and is great for family's but you can not pre book between 7- 9pm so you have to queue which can take 15/20mins before you get to the checkin desk then it's another 15/20mins way for a table, the food is like a American diner  But you get plenty and the staff keep you entertained with a small show etc, the kids will love it !!!! ENJOY",,
"Wow!!! This place was amazing, the huge queue outside every night shows that! Went as a couple so didn't have to wait long, had the nachos and a pizza to share, and the nachos were amazing! Wish we would have had time to go again, it really was delicious!",,
Visited here after being highly recommended. The restaurant has a nice layout and friendly staff. We had potato skin starter and chicken fajitas for main. Both meals were good but nothing i would rave about. It was like having a TGIF in Cyprus. The entertainment was good but again nothing amazing.  Maybe we were built up too much before we went and felt let down by what we got but we wouldn't rush back,,
What can i say about fat mamas you feel like it when you come out it has to be the best place in Cyprus that's why there is always a cue waiting to get in and what choice you have off two menus fantastic you have to pay a visit,,
"We visited Fat Mama's while in Paphos because each time we walked past people were queuing to get in, which is a good sign. We were welcomed by the friendly staff, always busy. Given our table then two menus, one Italian and one American. The choice of food on the menus is great, well priced as well. We ordered our food and my god, the portions were huge, even for the starters it was huge. If you do visit here, please make sure you are very hungry. While in the restaurant there are singers and dancers going around, and also stuff for the kids too, if its your birthday, you will get a free drink and happy birthday sang to you in front of everyone. Certainly an entertaining place. I would certainly re-visit Fat Mama's again, and recommend anyone to give it a go, you wont be disappointed.",,
Best food in Kato pathos wonderfully service. So well mannered and attentive staff.. girls fantastic at cabaret .they seemed to genuinely enjoy it.. absolute must to visit,,
Fantastic food and entertainment! Great selection of food and drinks on menu and the food was delicious portions are huge ! Very family friendly and they have singers and fat mama and Cowboy costumes go on for the kids entertainment. Service fantastic despite the place being queued out onto the street we had no problem getting a table when we had arrived pure luck I think if large group you should book table as this seems to be the most popular restaurant in this area. Staff very friendly and I would highly recommend !,,
"Great place huge portions, good show, will be revisiting before we leave 😀. The staff were amazing , please visit!! It's a great diner in amazing surroundings",,
"We ate here three times across a two week period as my daughter (20) enjoyed this restaurant. Food is plentiful but its hard to even finish the small portions!!    Always seems to be a big queue to enter but we never waited longer than 15 minutes for a table. Service at the table was a bit hit and miss, one night really good, another night, we had to ask three times for our drinks that we had ordered before they turned up.    Food is good we tried Spaghetti Bolognese, Hunters Chicken, Fajitas & the steaks across our visits and each dish was good & large.In addition they have a singer and three dancing ladies who put on a 15 minute cabaret show for the diners and will appear from time to time to sing Happy Birthday and deliver a cocktail to the birthday person.    Around our hotel heard a number of people chatting Fat Mamas so think it generally goes down well with families as a good place to eat out at.",,
"Was recommended to go to Fat Mamma's by a neighbour when they heard we were off to Pafos....    Not a restaurant for a quiet night out.. Dancers, singers and characters for the kids to have a photo with accompany the dining!    Get there early if you have not booked otherwise the queue goes down the street (August)!    Food is split into two menus: Italian or American. Portions are large! A small portion of ribs (kids) was a whole rack of ribs!!! The cowboy size portion was two racks of ribs!! Slight lack of vegetables but the kids weren't bothered!    Great selection on the menu and the staff, although busy, were friendly.    Face painting, hair braiding and temporary tattoos also feature on the sidewalk once you've finished dinner.!    Good fun night out for dinner.",,
"I have visited the restaurant in the past and had the spare ribs which is the house speciality. I really enjoyed the meal for the past four times. When I visited Paphos this year I went to have my favourite meal once again but unfortunately this time it was an absolute disappointment!!! The meat was boiled not cooked, had the smell and taste of raw meat and the sauce was a disaster. It was tasteless and meaningless. After a worthless attempt to have my meal I paid for it and informed tha waitress about the matter. The only response that I got was that she would mention it to the kitchen. That was all. No further response or attempt to solve the matter. I am so frustrated with their lack of professionalism. They lost a loyal, over the years customer with his friends for ever. I know that they run a successful business and 4-5 persons per year will do no much difference for their income but if they keep on serving such a poor quality of food they will end up closing at some point.",,
"Okay so there were a great deal of vegetarian options at this restaurant so we chose to come here. When we arrived, we had to wait a while to be seated but people behind us (party of 10) jumped the queue and the staff happily showed them to their seats. We had also booked in advance but just waited patiently. Once seated, we had to wait a long time before receiving a menu and then again for our food. It did not come altogether, in fact 3 of us got our food first and 2 ten minutes after. Also the fries did not arrive with the meal. As per previous reviews, the food in huge in quantity but certainly lacked taste/flavour. There were customers who came after us but were served before us. As it was my birthday - a birthday song was sung, but two of my boys were not at the table at the time so that was a missed opportunity. We were totally disappointed with the food and made a sharp exit.",,
"If you're looking for a light snack you're in the wrong place. I wasn't too hungry so I just asked for one of the starters to come as my main course. It was huge! I only managed about half of it. It tasted wonderful, but it was just too much food on the plate. They must throw so much in the bin. If you don't mind having something left on your plate then pay a visit!",,
We went in to Fat Mama's as a group of 4 adults & 2 Children be sure to arrive early or you will queue for a seat .  The entertainment team came out 3 times during our meal.  One of our group asked what is the size of the large as to the standard the waitress said the large is Challenging so we ordered a standard pork rib after 3/4 of it he was stuffed after dinner one of the Children in our group went for her Nails done ( at the end table ) Starter main & drinks for 6 only 65 euros,,
"We really enjoyed our meal at Fat Mammas! We got very lucky with the time we arrived; we waited for just less than 10 minutes to be seated but the queue was huge by the time we say down and stayed that way for the entire time we were there! It is obviously really popular so I would advise booking if you can. The menu is huge and offers big, crowd pleasing favourites like burgers, hotdogs, pasta and pizza. The portions are massive but our waitress was really accommodating when I asked to share a meal with my daughter and it arrived at the table already split on to two plates. There is a good atmosphere and singers and dancers perform popular songs every few minutes which was a really fun touch! We had read reviews before coming to Paphos and really wanted to eat here and were not all disappointed! Good food, good entertainment and nice cold beer...what more can you ask for!?!",,
"We are here twice as the first time was great...tasty food, good portions and efficient service despite being busy. The second time wasn't a good experience and therefore I'm reluctant to give any more than 3 out of 5. On the second occasion my husband and I were shown to our seats by a friendly waiter and after only a few minutes our orders were taken. So far so good. Then it all seemed to go a bit downhill...my husband's enchiladas arrived (by a young waiter who just plonked the incredibly hot plate down in the middle of the table and then walked off forcing my husband to have to pick up the plate using a napkin to actually get it in front of him) and my fajitas did not! I waited 10 minutes and then mentioned this to a pleasant young waitress who went to sort out the problem. Apparently they'd gone to a different table so by the time I actually received my meal my husband had almost finished his. The waitress then came over to apologise and we were offered a free drink each. We were happy with this as mistakes do happen (and they were incredibly busy after all) and otherwise the food was very tasty and good value for money. However the free drinks never arrived in the half an hour we remained for, so at this point we simply got the bill and walked away. We left disappointed and our tip reflected this.",,
Always busy and very good value for money. The entertainment is a real highlight. Staff are pleasant and helpful and looked professional in their aprons.,,
We dined here following a recommendation and we're happy with what we received. I had the large ribs and they were tasty and there was a lot. Would go again.,,
I really recommend this restaurant for all ages. Food is fresh Service is excellent. Great value for money.,,
Fat mama's is a very large and popular restaurant but we found the food very bland and tasteless after having to wait 40 minutes for a table were expecting a lot more than we got  What we did get was very large portions and not enough quality  We couldn't see what all the fuss was about there are a lot of better restaurants in paphos,,
Queued to get in here so was expecting something special. My food was okay. Large portions but no better than hotel I was staying in. That said others in my party raved about there selections and were impressed by the entertainment that is provided when you eat.,,
"Ok if you want a quiet or romantic meal aviod this place. It is a fun loud family place, yes the entertainmeny is a bit poor cruise ship but its free and it only lasts 10 minutes.  The food is well priced, as everyone says the portion size is large. The staff are friendly and happy which is nice.  So go take it for what it is and enjoy.",,
"During our stay in Paphos we ate here twice as we voted it one of our favourite meals there. Waiting staff are friendly, food is excellent and there's plenty of it. You never leave hungry. The singers coming out every now and then during the evening makes it a fun and entertaining meal.",,
"Went for dinner with the family, amazing quality and service, kids loved the show, great staff will be going back for sure when we are in paphos again.",,
"Before I start this review I will just say I knew what I was getting in for, a loud environment. However what I got was completely unexpected. The seating was fast. The place looked busy and yet we were seated within a minute. Once we sat down we ordered and the food was with us promptly despite their 25min wait time they stressed. The staff were also smiley and helpful for members of my party in food selection. The portions were large and the food was cheap, cannot complain about the dining in any way in regards to taste, quality or price.    What I did take exception to was the entertainment. It was incredibly loud. I know this is a family place and there is live dancing and music but the music is loud and relentless. My party were just trying to chat and we were getting blasted by ABBA, lord knows how those people next to the speakers coped; we were across the room and it was still bad. Whilst this would only be a small problem if it was infrequent it kept happening! Once a song died down we would be blasted with another, at least split them up in ten minute increments to make it a bit more bearable. The lights were also turned off and we were treated to some lacklustre fire dancing all whilst im trying to have a conversation whilst putting food to my mouth. Towards the end of the meal I was developing a headache; something I should never get at an restaurant!    Overall I found it to be a fantastic place for food, portions were big and the cost small. However I felt the environment let it down, but may be it is just because my culture doesn't endulge in that sort of dining entertainment.",,
"We were excited to try this place as we heard a lot of good things we went as a group of friends the atmosphere was great, the prices were great, cocktails were lovely, the amount of food we got was huge but it was pretty poor quality and non of us eat alot. But I would return and try a different meal.",,
"We noticed there were queue's outside this restaurant every night and figured it must be good. Having eaten here, I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. Think any UK chain restaurant, TGI Fridays or Chiquittos and that's what you get here with added school drama class dancing and singing from the 'waitresses'. Families, particularly one's with young daughters, seemed to lap this up, but it wasn't my kind of thing. I have to mention the staff who were brilliant in dealing with a very busy restaurant yet remaining happy and friendly.",,
"We went here for my husband's birthday but mainly because I thought the kids would enjoy it too. I didn't tell the staff about his birthday as it was a couple of days later and he wasn't bothered, but if I had he would of been sung to and got a free drink as lots of people did!  We arrived just before 7 and got a seat straight away. The waitress told us it was happy hour and 2 for 1 on cocktails so we got 2 cocktails each with plenty of umbrellas and sparklers etc!  The food was better then I expected we both ordered from the mexican menu and it was very good. The kids menu was also good.  The children were very well looked after with menus to colour in and the staff made a fuss of them.  Every so often the dancing girls would come out and do a routine. They were good and my daughter loved seeing the costumes which were different overtime. A bit later the characters ""Fat Mama"" and Cowboy Willy"" came out and the children could meet them and have their photo taken with them (no charge). There was also a lady doing face paints and glitter tattoos (you had to pay for these).  The staff were great, we were not rushed at all even though there were people queuing for tables later on.  It was a great evening for all of us. The only down side is the road works on the main road but they didn't affect the atmosphere. Would definitely visit again.",,
"Were recommended Fat Mama's & we're not disappointed at all. There was a fair size queue but only waited 5 minutes to be seated. The staff are really good & every so often dancers come out & do a short dance & sing a ""Happy Birthday"". They have the 2 characters come out for the kids as well.  The 2 menu's are American & Italian & there is so much to choose from.  I chose the Chili co carne, not the best I've tried but was very nice.  We visited again we got Ribs to start, meat was literally falling off the bone & sauce was delicious.  My wife got the Tagliatelle (child portion) &I got the Chilli burger.  Both were delicious. As others have said be aware the portions are MASSIVE, a good brisk walk is needed after.",,
"Sat in here as I type this. Great service, very nice food. Didn't wait long to be seen to. Entertainment as always is very good. This is a night out, not just a meal. Kids love it.",,
"Be prepared for a bit of wait if you want dinner at fat mamas! It is worth it though! By far the busiest restaurant in Paphos    The food was great and massive portions so go hungry. It's a mix of Italian and American style cuisine. We had the nachos for starter then my partner had a massive burger, which he really enjoyed and I had fajitas which were equally as nice!    We went on a Saturday night and they had entertainment (not sure if its the same other nights). There was singing and dancing and it really added to the atmosphere! We had a great night!    I'd definitely recommend a visit!",,
Great food large portions!!!! Very friendly staff. Very clean. Very lively. Great atmosphere. Staff entertaining through out the night. A must to visit. 5*****,,
"If you enjoy good food and great service combined with some live entertainment this is for you. The food was delicious but if you don't have a giant sizer appetite go for the smaller portions, these are still very big and excellent value for money. The staff were great and there were regular live shows to entertain you.",,
"I used to live in Paphos and unfortunately have been to this restaurant before as my kids love the singing and dancing of the staff while you are eating. The food portions are massive but all just fried food that is well over priced. The service was just so slow it took over an hour to get any food and then one of the items we ordered was missing, there is just a lack of customer care. When we went to pay the bill showed a 10% discount but when we tried to pay by our debit card the waitress told us the discount was only for cash obviously so it didn't have to go through the books, we are in Cyprus after all.",,
"During our resent holiday we went to Fat mama's twice.  Food - very good, only complaint if you can call it that is the portions are very large. First time we seemed to have left more than we ate.  Service - very good and friendly.  Entertainment - the young ladies do a very good job with songs and dancing.    Suggestions - if you can phone to book a table as it does get very busy.",,
The food was good here portions were massive staff very efficient this place was full every night enjoyable,,
Food was good but service could have been better from some of the staff. Food portions are very big if you are not a big eater I would eat from the kids menu although my daughter had the child's ribs and that was bigger than the adults small portion of ribs.,,
Me and my boyfriend arrived at Fat Mamas just before closing time. It was packed and they still managed to sit us down in a few minutes. We ordered the ribs to start which we shared - they were amazing. Then we shared the enchiladas and the fajitas for our main. Service was brilliant and food was amazing. There was so much food we ended up taking most of it home. I preferred the enchiladas to the fajitas. Will definately be returning if i return to Paphos!,,
Great place for families. We stayed in an apartment block with no evening entertainment so fat mamas was a welcome change. Great entertainment and delicious food - I had the chilli chicken and it was perfect. Huge portions though so couldn't finish it all but spot on X,,
"Ate here about 10 times whilst in paphos for 7 weeks, food great and huge portions!! Lovely staff always friendly. Recommended if in paphos",,
"Awesome food, huge portions!!! Very yummy starters and mains and the entertainment also good! Eating food whilst staff randomly breaking out in song and dance! Extremely busy, best to book!",,
"Was told about this place by a friend who comes every year and loves the place. Had to wait but no big problem, told to take a seat in the bar.    A quick appartif before sitting down but there was tables empty, seems that the volume of traffic just too much for the staff.    Finally got a table, menu split in two steaks etc american and traditional .  Ordered starters, came with in minutes and we were all amazed at the size, great taste all enjoyed.    The main course however seemed to take for ever. Well over half an hour and this was with a questioning look to the waitress.    The entertainment was ok and Abba has no worries about coming back but it did take your mind off the wait.    The main course's were good, nice pizzas and salads ok kids meals great size.    Cost ok, family of four three course's and drinks with tip just under €90. In the end you get what you pay for    Just a pity about the wait.",,
Saw from taxi and the went next night very good quick service with good food and wine price not to high staff very good and friendly Good entertainment was a plus,,
Visited here after spotting it packed most nights. Wide menu serving a range of Italian food and American smokehouse items! Portions are massive and you can get a 6oz fillet steak with sauce and chips for €16.    Every 15 minutes dancers and singers come into the restaurant and sing different songs- gives the place some life!!!!    Don't visit if you want a quiet meal!,,
"This restaurant was recommended to us, so we went to have a look, stayed for a meal from a very good menu with plenty of choice. Entertainment was good.",,
We visited here after reading some good reviews. When we arrived we had to queue up to get a seat and parties of people just kept arriving so shows how popular it is. Because it was so busy we were amazed how quickly we got served. Food was lovely and reasonably priced. Would definitely visit again.,,
3rd time visiting this restaurant and the quality and service hasn't changed. Love the food here and the portions are pretty big too. All the staff are really nice and the young guy who came to clear our table was extremely polite and pleasant. He was the owners young son just working while on holidays. Will definitely be back next time.,,
"We love it here. The staff, the food, the entertainment; everything is excellent.  Starting with the BBQ ribs which are a meal in themselves, all our party had steak. Apart from my son who had a mountain of spaghetti bolognaise (child portion!)    Steaks were cooked to perfection and the sauces were so tasty.    We will definitely come back on our next jaunt to Paphos.    I recommend pre-booking!",,
"Good value, large portions, friendly staff and gorgeous pizzas. Only a short walk from the Damon hotel and opposite a lovely Irish bar o'neills",,
"Decided on a visit here after noticing the place on a previous visit to Paphos. Great atmosphere and good for kids, very attentive staff and quick Service. I had the ribs which were huge and superb value for money, my wife and kids had burgers which were massive and was nowhere near finished after very good attempts. I'd visit here again",,
"We first went to Fat Mama's 20 years ago, on our first of five trips to Paphos. It really is a great night out, with our without kids. The service on arrival is always welcoming, although I would advise booking. We arrived quite early in the evening and it was already busy. There is regular entertainment from the waiting staff with a spot of dancing, and if you are shy in any way, don't tell them you are celebrating anything! We've never been disappointed with the food, and this particular visit was no exception. Ribs (wife's choice) are a must, as are the fajitas (no 1 son). No 2 son and I had a burger which again was excellent. Expect big portions!",,
"We visit this place twice on our holiday, one of the best places to eat. Food portions where large and very filling. If it's your birthday or anniversary they go out there way to sing to you.",,
"We visited Fat Mamas twice during our 2 week stay in Paphos after last eating there 10 years ago.  The restaurant is always extremely busy so maybe a good idea to book. The first dining experience was very good. Fantastic, quick service. Hot tasty food. And they were really busy.  Unfortunately the second occasion was not quite as good. Had to queue to be seated but this wasn't a problem. There were plenty of empty tables but the staff just didn't seem to able to cope on this occasion. The service was slow and my son ended up being sick all night afterwards. Such a shame as our memories from 10 years ago have now been somewhat tainted.  The entertainment however was very good.",,
we were invited to Fat Mamas for a friends bday dinner. the food portions are very large so i would recommend you go on an empty stomach. the ribs were delicious and the fajitas looked delicious too. there is also Live ENTERTAINMENT of singing and dancing which is great for Children. and there is also a table with a lady doing some face painting and tatoos for Children.,,
"We visited this restaurant today after a recommendation of our friend. I thought that it was a Mexican restaurant but it was a Mexican-Italian-steak house.  There are some pros & some cons:  Pros: very good service, big plates, overall good food, some events/happenings.  Cons: location (it is on a big street), my plate ( fajitas with steak) was bad, prices ( high)  On the contrary my wife took chicken fajitas and was delicious.  Finally I had more expectations from the specific restaurant.",,
"we visited as a family of 3 with our 9 year old Son. They do a discount if you eat before 7.30, which was perfect for us, they also had Bogof on small beers and large soft drinks. We ordered pizza, spag Bol and mini pizza. The pizza was so light and absolutely amazing and the spag Bol so tasty, not over tomatoey or liquids just really good, I sent my compliments to the chef, which doesn't happen often. Colouring book and crayons provided to entertain son, staff excellent, extremely good value with discount but would also be happy to pay full price. Would definitely visit again, best meal of our holiday.",,
Had an excellent meal here. Wish we found it earlier. Portions big and plenty of choice. Reasonably priced. Good choice of kids meals. Sports on TVs and water mist sprays to keep it cool. Seems that English expacts come here frequently so must be good.,,
Loved it here. We came a couple of times. I think the entertainment during dinner is a good touch. (Felt like a cheeper version of the Benidorm Palace). I had a burger the first time and my wife had the steak MR. Instantly wanted to swich plates after she let me try a bit of her steak. It was awsome. Will be back this october. See you soon guys.,,
Fabulous food and massive portions my fella went into a food coma after the massive enchiladas that were the best he has ever tasted! Would definitely recommend. It always has an atmosphere and all the staff work extra hard to ensure everyone is always happy and looked after! The only place you cue to get a table but it never disappoints!,,
Met up with friends and family here a few days after attending a wedding well worth it! Low prices huge portions and tasty!!,,
Whilst staying at Laura beach we visited the bar 3 times for food. Great burgers great hospitality and warm friendly service. Love the air con!,,
Always make a point of eating here. Great food but do not order starters. The main is enough for two. Fantastic Value for money,,
"This is a hard one as it should be a very good experience, BUT, service was poor, forgot our daughters food, drinks slow. The portions from the main menu are big eg Ribs. The kids amusement area kind of did not work so the kids felt the 1 Euro machines are a bit of a scam. Given the food and service was poor, the positive and its a big positive is that the Management gave us a free main course and 10% off so they know how to solve issues without fuss. The entertainment was good if not dated but it makes the place fun and you want fun on holiday. We would go again.",,
Nice food friendly staff and reasonable prices also didn't have to wait too long for our food. The place itself is ok nothing special to look at or dine in but would go again if I'm in the area.,,
"Having tried to go a couple of times but been turned off by the queue, we decided to go a bit earlier. We arrived at 6pm, to discover a discount and cocktails and fizzy drinks are 2 for 1 at the moment if you sit before 6. We had a starter to share between 3 and I ordered the small ribs, thankfully as I couldn't finish. Dessert was lovely. There's a great choice for kids. A great atmosphere, staff were friendly and attentive even as the place got busier. It was full and there was a big queue by the time we left at 7.40. Loved it and would definitely go again.",,
Fantastic diner - staff great and food was amazing (well the ribs anyway - as that's all my party had!). Dancing girls add very little to the experience as pretty poor....couldn't really see the point. Don't be fooled by the fact there is always a queue - oldest one in the book to make it look busy and exclusive - there was always seats available even when there was a queue. Simply there for the food and drink and tasted amazing + portions very large. Guy sitting next to me had the biggest burger ever...must have been good as he consumed the lot. Pretty good value also. Location pretty poor mind...in a resort of fantastic view restaurants this one looks out to a busy main road. All about the food.,,
Went to this place after having it recommended.Went early as it opens at 5pm and later it gets busy.Food was fantastic.Only thing I would say is make sure you are really hungry before you go.Huge portions.The service from the staff is exceptional.Very attentive and friendly and really look after customers.It's a must visit if you are in Paphos.,,
"We'd been recommended this place by colleagues and booked ahead. We weren't disappointed - huge portions, entertainment and a great family vibe. The customer service was excellent - after a small mixup, it was rectified quickly and professionally. Burgers huge, pizza full plates and steak perfect. Kids had fun, parents had cocktails - good time by all.",,
"Went as a family of four and the restaurant is busy and buzzing with light entertainment in form of cowgirl dancing. The sizes of the portions are big.    We had two adult mains (ribs and hunters chicken) one chocolate cake dessert to share, two pints for me and two diet cokes for the lady and it came to €66. Then the children had basic child meals drinks and dessert at €20.    The food was nice and large portions, the service was good and the atmosphere was good so overall worth a visit during your time in Paphos.",,
Great food good service. The only advice is if you are a party over 4 then it's an idea to book a table as its peak and very busy.,,
What an evening! Fantastic food and prices. Make sure you book prior to turning up as extremely busy to the point customers were being turned away.    Entertainment was fantastic for all the family with dancing etc which really made the evening something different.  Fantastic staff working really hard to keep you happy.  Would definitely recommend as I have an extremely fussy family but they all filled there face and we all struggled in the heat to walk it off :-)  Will definitely return and will look forward to doing so.,,
"Enjoyed a good evening at Fat Mamas, a worthy restaurant to finish our holiday. It was a great venue for kids and families with exciting entertainment and small activity booklets for the children. Food was nice but nothing amazing although the menu did provide variety comparative to the bog standard choices to most other restaurants in the vicinity. Nach-yo' average Nachos, they were simply amazing!!! Most portions, including children's, were larger than the norm- we all left the restaurant looking like fat mamas!",,
"Worth a visit, great food, huge portions and plenty to choose from two menus. Prices comparable with other restaurants in the area.  We went early, before 7pm, as it gets very busy and we hadn't booked. We got a table straight away.  Starters of garlic bread and nachos to share. One portion of each was more than enough for four to share.  My daughter and I shared Mexican Fajitas, and were able to order extra wraps. I can definitely recommend them. Enough for two of us but if you're feeling very hungry one person could eat the lot, delicious! My husband ordered a 'small' rack of ribs and had plenty. He would never have managed the large portion by himself!  My son's pizza was the only disappointment, if you're after pizza visit the Italian Pizza restaurant further up the road. They really specialise so, as you would expect, their pizzas are excellent.  The food arrives very quickly and although we didn't feel rushed we did get the impression that they wanted us out quickly so that they could get the next customs in.  Definitely recommend this place, worth booking to avoid disappointment.",,
What a great find really enjoyed r visit at this place. Very bad entertainment which was actually funny to watch as so bad.  If I was staying for 2 weeks I would return to this place. Go for the ribs people there to die for but just get small as potions r stupidly to big.,,
We visited in May so the season hadn't got too busy. Food was good here and we ate twice with the staff remembering where we had sat the previous visit. Be warned portions are massive but good quality tasty food and not too pricey. Staff are friendly and efficient.m,,
Have to wait even with reservation. They make people to wait just to show off. Tables are empty and they do not seat peope. What a joke! The Host got on my nerves. Has an attitude problem. Food is ok. Not a big deal. Waitress hard to find. Some are just moving around picking up glasses. Would't go again. Too much deal for a burger or steak or untasty ribs!,,
"We visit this restaurant every time we are in Cyprus. Excellent choice of food, choice of 2 menus. Fat Mama's is Italian American style and Willy's is ribs etc. Good entertainment but the outfits for Fat Mama and Willy are looking a little worn and could do with replacing (or a wash at least). Wouldn't be described as cheap, but it is in Paphos where prices are higher than villages.",,
highly recommended A must to visit 😍 Staff very friendly and entertainment is brilliant Huge portions of fabulous food,,
"Brilliant food, service was fantastic. Loved the song break outs. Really surprised! We only came as our little one liked the name. Loads going on. Well worth a visit if your with kids. Really enjoyed this place.",,
We came here for the last night of our honeymoon and while the staff where friendly we felt a little rushed and the food while nice seemed pricy compared to other places we had dined. It was really busy so plenty must like it but think its more of a family restaurant.,,
"A visit to Fat Mamas in Paphos, Cyprus is a must especially if you have children with you. At certain times of the evening Fat Mama makes an appearance and will have her photograph taken with your family. On arrival you are normally asked if you are celebrating anything then during the course of your visit staff will come out and dance to a song and then depending on your celebration will bring you a bottle of champers, a cake or a drink. The food is fantastic but beware the portions are enormous and come in varying sizes.",,
"I would just like to say that fat mama's and cowboy willie's is one of the best restaurants around,if you are on holiday in Paphos you must try this place,you will not be disappointed.The food is great whatever you have,we have tried the rib's,fillet steak,lasagne and the chicken,all cooked to perfection.There is also the fat mama's dancers that put on a great show and they are always out and about the restaurant surprising people if they are celebrating anything special.In summertime it can be really busy so sometime's you might have to wait to get a table but it's worth the wait,but it's not a long wait.Anyway give it a try.",,
"We went with 6 teens and everyone had a great time. Regular madcap entertainment from cheerleader types running amok amongst the eaters.  Bill for 8 including drinks was €200, so no complaints there.  We bought back a full pizza.  We booked as there was 8 of us, and they were queuing around the block when we got there at 8pm.",,
"Visited Fat Mamas based on their Trip Advisor reviews and rating and my experience has made this a very difficult review to write!    The food was good - I had a lovely pizza and there were good veggie options available (huzzah!) and there was a lively atmosphere (lots of singing, ""Mama"" and ""Willy"", and nail art/airbrushing etc) - this would have resulted in a high star rating. However, it took an hour and a half for our food to arrive. We didn't really notice to start with as we were enjoying our own company and the entertainment (and weren't interrupted for repeated drinks orders :()so we didn't kick up a fuss. We were given a free beer to make up for it when we were (eventually!) told that our order had been lost (and not that the kitchen was backed up).    The standard of service seriously let Fat Mamas down. If you're going, go early to save queuing! Hopefully ours was a one-off experience - had the service been better I would be recommending Fat Mamas wholeheartedly. However, I can't bare poor service!",,
Food is perfect big portions 2 menus to choose from either Italian or american style. Also there's entertainment wile you are eating. Brilliant place if you are having a party as they get involved and make sure it's a good time for you.,,
"Visited this place because it was soo busy inside. Our cokes served were completely flat, asked for new ones which were given reluctantly..  They were still flat and we came to the conclusion it probably wasnt actual coke cola. When my drink arrived i took the ice out having forgot to ask so i took it out myself to save the trouble and put it on a plate that had been used for the starter, was asked by waitor why i didnt say no ice?! Like a naughty school kid.    Food was really average, nothing to write home about.  Good atmosphere in the place, the live entertainment wasnt expected and was a quite cheesy but hey!",,
We have visited this twice now on 2 separate holidays and both times it was the worst meal of the holiday. Both times it was uncomfortably hot and the meals were just about ok. There are so many better places to eat in Paphos.,,
My party of 11 went here a few nights the food was great very large portions the ribs are great I would recommend fat mamas,,
"Went to Fat Mama's on 25th July for out 18th Wedding anniversary meal - it was superb but portions are so large you can't walk after - Ribs 10/10, Pizza was good, burgers were fantastic and the Chilli sauce - wow.  Dancers at table and a bottle of bubbly finished it off - fantatstic",,
The portions are huge here and the staff are very friendly with a little entertainment thrown in. Well worth a visit.,,
"Went for food here again this year, we all had stakes again. All cooked to perfection and plenty of food. This is a very busy restaurant, so book in advance or you might be disappointed as the queues are quite long at peek times. having said that the turnaround is very good.",,
Excellent night out. Good staff. Good value. HUGE POTTIONS. Entertaient was good. Well worth what we paid. Defo be back.,,
"We paid Fat Mama's a visit during our stay in Paphos, it has a great atmosphere with really friendly staff. The portion sizes are huge!!!!!  Yes its not traditional greek food but this place has been going for 20 years in Paphos.  I would say its well worth a visit if your in Paphos.",,
"Oh my god,such a fantastic atmosphere.Food was lush,service was excellent and the singing and dancing was spot on.All ages and family welcome.Also have face painting,nail art and henna tattoos for all.Will definitely be going back here",,
"I am very surprised to see the popularity of this restaurant and the only reason I can think of is because British tourists can relate to the Americanized atmosphere and menu. There are several more traditional restaurants along this strip whereby you have excellent service, great food and know you are contributing towards local families. Now, the main reason I have taken to write this review was seeing a response to a customer giving a critical review on the fat mama's Facebook page. The response from the restaurant was unprofessional, rude and will eventually spell their demise.  Me and my partner are a young couple who visited this restaurant last week purely because of its supposed popularity. After having queued up we were stood waiting for 5 minutes until I had to actually ask a member of staff whether we could be seated to which they took us to a table. They had recognized our presence prior to this so we were confused why we were not acknowledged. Upon being seated we were served promptly whereby we ordered two cokes and a bottle of wine. The cokes were delivered quickly but it tasted very much like unbranded coca cola so we left them. The wine also had the old label ripped off and a ""Fat Mama's"" label glued on over the top which gave no indication as to what wine it actually was because I refuse to believe the restaurant produces its own wine. We ordered our food and it was average, i would compare it to a chain such as Sizzling Pubs or Fayre and Square - there was no authenticity or care.  There was entertainment, British entertainment by girls who were again, average performers. Although I will say that it was a nice touch to have entertainment. If you come on holiday to visit a chain restaurant such as the aforementioned then this place is perfect for you. If you prefer good service with free bread, fruit and good wine, then walk a little further down the strip.",,
"Went on recommendation.  Served very quickly and the food arrived immediately, almost too quickly.  Got the feeling they needed to turn the table round for a later booking.  That being said, staff were attentive and the food was good and plentiful and hot.  Ordered full ribs and only just finished it.  Some girls came out singing, which was a bit awkward but added a bit of fun.  The staff dressed in Cowboy Willy and Fat Mamma costumes were fun for little ones but looked dated.  Despite having lots of tables they do keep a queue out the front so it looks busy to passing trade.  I'd go again but probably later on, as we booked for 18:30.",,
After reading some of the reviews on here I couldn't wait to visit Fat Mamas and it didn't disappoint. The food was plentiful and reasonably priced. Would recommend for families as the entertainment is great for youngsters.,,
"We visited Fat Mamas with friends who had been before and it was great. The food was delicious and the portions are big, thankfully we shared starters and are so glad that we did. Service is great too but i would thoroughly recommend booking a table as it gets busy and you may have to wait. I was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment too which I wasn't expecting and it was great. The staff also make a huge effort for those who are celebrating a birthday or anniversary. Definitely worth a visit when in Paphos.",,
"A very good place to eat with a wide selection of grilled food available for the whole family.    The wait was a little long due to how busy the restaurant was, but we were seated within 15 mins. We had a group of 4 adults plus 1 infant and were accommodated no problems at all.    The service was quick and the portions very big. I did not need to order a starter as the main was big enough.    The only downside to this restaurant was the cheesy entertainment and singing, very TGI Friday-ish, and also the heat. The restaurant had fans but we just happened to be in the only location without a fan on our table.    Overall, a good restaurant with good food and good service.    We are here for a 2nd week so will probably go here again.",,
Visited on last evening of our holiday in Paphos. Arrive before 7 to get 10% of your bill.Staff very friendly and efficient. Good quality Tex Mex/ Italian fare. Loads to choose from - very large portions which they are happy to wrap up to take away if you can't finish. 2 large starters+ 2 large pizzas+ 2 puddings and 4 soft drinks was €45 . 3 girl singer/ dancers who randomly burst into action for anyone with a birthday/ anniversary etc + longer set about 9ish. Great evening all round - wish our hotel had been that good!! A most see when visiting Paphos.,,
Good for families but very americanised and noisy. You always have to queue to get a table. It's good for ribs burgers etc but if you want traditional Cypriot food then this is not for you Very child friendly,,
"Food ok, bit like a TGI/Frankie & Bennys type place, not a great variety but the entertainment is good.",,
fantastic food at a great price with entertainment thrown in good night out with or without the kids always got great service as well would suggest arriving early as can get busy around 19:00 but even then we didn't have to wait long for a table,,
"Can't fault the service or the food and there's plenty of it and not expensive, the place to go if you have kids",,
this is an amazing restaurant we ate here a couple of times and wasnt disappointed very friendley staff excellent entertainment,,
"Came with my partner having high expectations due to the clear popularity of the restaurant and we have never been so disappointed. I had a Halloumi Burger which had no taste to it whatsoever, and my partner ordered the Beef Fajitas - the beef was too chewy, the vegetables undercooked and was only given 3 small wraps to make the fajitas. In addition to this, we waited 40 minutes after finishing our food for it to be taken away.    We complained but they only had apologies to offer.    The worst meal we had in Cyprus.    The atmosphere is good for family's and young children only.",,
"As per other reviews, we can confirm that portion sizes are huge. However, that's only good if food is of a good standard - this really wasn't.    Burgers etc were of a very average standard - frozen chips and overcooked burgers. Fajitas were also similarly average. To be fair, food was cheapish.    There was some form of 'cabarat' show if you like that sort of thing - I don't.    Not to be recommended",,
"Best ribs ever! A++++ Its allways full so call them! Good music and good staff! Must must must! Try the ribs,and the oven poteto",,
Lovely food great atmosphere it was sons birthday the day after we got home but they still made a fuss and bought him a cocktail and did a dance for him - he was 8 he loved it. Not somewhere to go every night but as a special meal for on hols was definitely worth a visit,,
"Wow! What an amazing place. On the first visit we were blown away - buy one get one free cocktails 6-7pm which were fantastic, live entertainment, friendly attentive staff and amazing food. Enjoyed it so much we went again a few days later for our final night. If only we had found this gem of a place earlier...we'd have been there every night!!",,
"Went with my daughter (9) and we sheared the ""Meat lover"" which was really good (especially the ribs!!!) and there was plenty of it ;-) Entertainment was good fun and the service was great :D would go again if we ever end up near Paphos again. Which we probably won't but that's another story...",,
"Ate here last year on our first visit to Paphos, was recommended to us, food was so good the first time we visited we went back again this year on our 2nd visit to Paphos and there was no disappointment 2nd time around, great food, great atmosphere and lovely staff.    Recommend a visit by anyone staying in Paphos.",,
do not eat all day if you want to finish a meal its not called fat mama's for nothing meals were beautiful they have 2 menus Italian and American and you can mix and match from either,,
"Wow what a fantastic place it was so good we went twice during our stay in paphos outstanding staff, service and food is out of this world the dancing girls where superb they had face painting for the little ones on the lawn there is a special appearance by fat mama and cowboy willy and also there is a wonderful cabaret show one tip I would advise you to go early as the restaurant gets very busy",,
"Visited fat mamas twice during our 2week holiday in pathos. Cannot recommend it enough, food and atmosphere is fab with a good menu choice all round for the grown ups and kids. Would go back to paphos again just to go here!",,
The staff are vile. The food is vile. The entertainment is vile. It's not clean. It's expensive. Sorry but I cannot find one positive about this place.,,
"On arrival in Paphos our private transfer was taking us to the Avlida where we stayed and I asked Drive ""is there anywhere you would recommend us to eat as we like to have the odd meal out even though we are all inclusive"". His reply was instant and he said ""Fat Mama's"".    We had a chat about it as you do and that was that really and then one day by the pool in the hotel another English couple stopped us and said ""have you tried Fat Mama's?"" Well that was it we had to go and I can assure everyone that this place does not disappoint.    It is a cross between Italian and American style food, there is music and live entertainment and the atmosphere is brilliant.    I had a fillet steak which was cooked absolutely to perfection, the two kids (both 16) had different pasta meals which looked amazing and the wife's meal was also great.    You cannot fault this restaurant and it's very very easy to see why it's so highly recommended. Make a point of going there if you get chance!!!",,
"We ate at Fat Mama's on two occasions during our stay in Paphos. The restaurant is very popular and always busy with locals and tourists however we never waited long for a table on our first visit (approx 15 mins) and were seated immediately on our second visit. This place has a great atmosphere and its down to the hardworking waiting staff and dancers. The food definitely reflects the name as the portions are huge, and i mean huge. I ordered the cheese garlic bread for starters which was really tasty and served in a bowl (4 large slices). This starter would easily satisfy two people. I also ordered a small portion of ribs but could only eat 1/3 of them. They would be considered a large portion anywhere else. They were cooked in a barbaque sauce and were absoloutly delicious, served with fries on the side. My husband order steak fajitas and they were yummy too. Would definitely recommend a visit.",,
This is the place to go if you have a large appetite - very good for children too. Entertainment for both children and adults - a very popular place,,
"Was recommended to us, and was not disappointed. Prices very reasonable and food was great. Portions on the large side, wife has lasagne could only eat a 1/3rd of it.",,
Would recommend you to go along great place. You get a choice of small or large potions would recommend small as the larger are very big. Great service lots of staff can't do enough for you. Gets very busy would book and has great entertainment,,
"I ordered the large ribs thinking it would be stingy with the portion. I couldn't have been more wrong. I almost ate it all but because you get chips, I couldn't help but soak up the awesome sauce which defeated me, but no worries, they wrapped up my leftover ribs to take away. Nice touch. Staff were great and you buy one cocktail get one free. Bonus.",,
"Visited here whilst on annual family holiday, 9 in total. Food is good, service is good, they are friendly happy and make you feel welcome. They usually have a show on and it makes a great family night out.",,
"Good Food, Excellent Service. Fun entertainment. Had the Sizzling Beef. Wife had the chicken. Lots of roadworks outside as they are re-doing the main road, but this didn't effect the night.",,
"I was shown to a table , ""one minute I will bring the menu"". . I waited and waited , did not shout, whistle, speak, or click my fingers I was polite perhaps too polite just a discreet wave to attract attention but I was ignored for 15 minutes .  People nearby coming in after me we being served drinks and in some cases food .  Very poor and....... Fat Mama's you should know who I was . I was shown to a table first right at the front entrance 12th July 2016 shown to a table at 1955 and left at 2015 hours because I wrote a polite message of my treatment on a napkin walked inside and gave it to the person on the desk . I walked out still invisible unchallenged  Disgraceful",,
Been many times and is still one of the best value family friendly restaurants in paphos - despite all the road works blocking you stoping outside still going strong - excellent for young kids too but be warned huge portions - value for money guaranteed,,
"lovely food , great service fab show and fab staff !!! me and my mum came here twice we loved it. The food was fab,",,
"Nice location, good food, generous portions. We tried the ribs and they were good. Also has a mini show that runs for about 20-30 minutes.",,
Enjoyable evening good food and good portion sizes. Would recommend to anyone visiting paphos. Entertainment for families and very friendly staff,,
Very nice food and huge portions. Nice entertainment and attentative staff. Very popular. A lot of guests every night.,,
An excellent place to eat. Good portion sizes and good quality too. Impromptu dancing to celebrate birthdays etc. And a decent show near the end of the night. Well worth the visit and we'll be back again next year just as we have been for the last 15 years.,,
"I would totally recommend you don't snack before going here,the portion size is amazing great value,great food,great service and great entertainment fat mammas is a must if you go to paphos",,
"Our last night in cyprus and what better way to end it with a meal at Fat Mamas. Food very tasty, service fab,entertainment worth watching and reasonable prices also.",,
"Recently stayed near to fat mamas and ate here twice, advisable to book, very good price for large tasty portions, there was some brief entertainment around 9pm which was a nice touch, would definitely eat here again",,
"We went here in July and the amount of food you get is huge!!  My friends all had starters but then couldnt manage their main meals!!  The food itself is lovely, and well priced but there is loads of it!!  The place itself is clean and comfortable and the staff are very attentive!    Would definitely recommend Fat Mama's without a shadow of doubt!!",,
Good place if celebrating as get free bubbly! Can sit outside. Huge portions - share a starter! THe small pasta sizing is actually plenty large enough for an adult.,,
"Fat Mama's is the type of restaurant we all look for on holiday: good & plentiful food, helpful staff and great entertainment - all at a reasonable price!    It's been 18mths since we last visit and we weren't disappointed :) It was also our friends birthday, so they did their usual trick of placing the funny hat on the birthday boy, the dancers sang happy birthday & he received a free non-alcoholic cocktail - a nice little touch I think.    Entertainment was still good and gets everyone clapping along - there's even animacion characters: Fat Mama & Cowboy Willy for the kids to get involved with, all good fun!    Portion sizes here are big, so if you're a light eater I'd order the small size portion as you'll never get to finish the regular one!!    Thoroughly recommend for couples, families with kids or just a fun night out!",,
Great food asked for a small portion and couldn't believe how big it was. The entertainment and staff were great. Would go again.,,
"Had a meal with my partner here and have always visited whenever we've been to Cyprus. Staff are very nice and welcoming, the food is brilliant and the prices are great too. Beware of the brilliantly large portions!",,
"We were recommended this restaurant by our rep who said it was excellent value for money. Yes it was fairly cheap but the food was basic and the waiters didn't have a clue of what the meals were when they were serving us. The draught beer was watered down and the caberet they had on were awful, they couldn't sing and couldn't dance either.    If you're on a budget and don't mind lots of screaming kids running around then eat here otherwise stay clear!",,
"Take your appetite as even the smaller portions are BIG ...Went twice and had 2 great meals .... plates are huge so as to get the portions on them ...Very reasonable prices, gets very busy but plenty staff to serve you ...Even has resident singers/dancers And the little 3 year old daughter of lady who works there knows ALL the dance moves :-)",,
"When in paphos Cyprus. I always visit fat mama,s. It is one of the best restaurants I have visited. The menu has loads of choice to suit everyone. The food is always amazing and I love the entertainment. The staff are all so helpful and there is always a visit from ft mama herself.",,
"We had a fab time here having a meal to celebrate my sisters wedding, food was lovely and big portions too",,
"I visited here with my boyfriend whilst on holiday. Staff and service amazing, very friendly. Food was amazing, the nachos are a must! There is a show put on during your meal which is a bit of fun also.  Will definitely be back the next time I visit Cyprus.",,
"Been here a few times but the last time i was here the waitress took my drink from me before i was finished.  The food is very tgi friday.  The staff do work hard and is very american style when the staff burst into a song or dance when certain tunes are played.  Characters come out which is good for the kids.  Theres a mini show during service at certain times, i dont understand this in the restaurant concept.  Food is good and vast choice.",,
Must visit everything about this place is great Food entertainment staff. Always tell friends that are going to pathos to try it . Everyone has raved about it when they get home 🍖🍔🍟🍝🍺🍹🍴,,
"We came here on out first full day of our holiday on the recommendation of about 40 people.  We absolutely loved the food, atmosphere and staff.  It's not the cheapest restaurant on Tomb of the Kings Road but it is well worth as the food is amazing!",,
"Good food not sure about the dancers Good menu and nice prices, very busy not sure if I would visit again as it we felt very crammed in on the tables",,
"Great food, don't try manage 3 courses though... Huge portions and great friendly staff. The dancing is great and the prices are reasonable",,
This is the second time we are visiting Fat Mamas. My kids love this place. Again the service was excellent. Show was ok. Crowded as always. The portions were massive and the food was very tasty. But I think may be the cooker has changed from last year because we ordered the same food as last year but it tasted a kind of different. Of course we still loved it and we will surely visit this restaurant again.,,
I would deffo go there brilliant night out and great food.entertainment was brilliant and good for kids,,
"We visited Cyprus for 2 weeks, ate here 4 times during that time. The food here was amazing, massive portions even if you don't order mama size I found it hard to finish...I didn't manage to finish anything I got! Service was great, as well as the entertainment- my little boy loved seeing fat mama & cowboy Willie.  Definitely the best meal we had.",,
"As usual we always celebrate the kids birthdays at Fat Mamas, and this year were no exception.  The service is great, cheerful and attentive waiters, excellent steaks cooked to perfection and omg the goodfather's chocolate fudge cake! Several shows during the evening and of course private song and drink for the birthday boy!  Can absolutely recommend!",,
"Been here many times in the past and not how I remembered! I always remembered a lot of entertainment, heavingly busy and queues.    Arrived both times last week at about 6 and no queues! Between 5-7 is happy hour which means 2 for 1 cocktails and 10% discount off your bill!! FANTASTIC!! made a cheap night out.    Amazing food! Massive portions! And staff are lovely!    Entertainment wasn't great but it might have been better later with more people. Not sure if it would have been busier later or not.    Definitely worth a visit!! Even a small meal would fill you up!! And a large was a struggle to finish!!",,
"Fat mamas is a great place for the food and the atmosphere, the meal was lovely, but we felt we rushed a little bit as the place is always really really busy , it's like NEXT! Great place to take the kiddies !",,
Where do we start. YOU MUST EAT HERE.    A real gem in Paphos crown.    The welcome was great we were shown to our table then we was presented with two glasses of champagne as we were celebrating our 7th wedding anniversary.    Starters cheesy mushrooms. Great  Main large steak with rattle snake sauce (hot!!!!) fajitas sizzling at the table awesome  Sweet. Strawberry ice cream a great end to great meal.    The meal for both of us including couple drinks €80 worth every cent.    During the night Cabaret.    This place is a must visit. Don't be put off by road works we was advised be done by August. We are already planning a visit when we are there in September again.,,
"Nice food, little bit expensive but you do get a lot of food. Not much entertainment going on. Lots of staff. chips were very nice!!",,
"Myself and my partner visited here after many recommendations from people we know At home who had been. The food was good typical American ribs burgers meat pizzas etc, LARGE portions so go hungry! It's great for those who like that kind of food, I had a pizza which was made from scratch as you could see the chef making the base from the table! It had a huge salad on top too, my partner had surf and Turf. All in all was a good meal. Great for family's as has lots of choice and entertainment too!",,
"The food is not very expensive, because You receive very big portions, so I don't recommend to order big portions for women, small is big enough to feel full. They do not have traditional/national food here, only American fast food or just ordinary chicken, veal and fish or pizza. What is special - there is nice cabaret performance at 8 pm, do not miss it :) The service is good enough, but we were waiting for our bill for a long time probably because of many people in the evening.",,
"I have eaten a lot of steak meals in my life but this was exceptional!! It was so nice, we had to return the next day just to check if it was just a fluke. The next meal was every bit as good. Service was excellent and the meal was interspersed with a trio of dancing girls who serenaded anyone celebrating a special occasion. A fabulous experience all round.",,
"Came here with friends and family the night before my wedding, it is a lively venue with a good atmosphere. The cocktails were good , the food really good, the portions huge. We all had a laugh and walked out very full , the ribs are highly recommended, as are the steaks. If you like a quiet evening meal, this may not be your venue , but for a lively fun evening with dancing girls and friendly service, this place is well worth a visit in Paphos.",,
"If you're looking for somewhere really decent for dinner- look no further!! For €17 you get 3 racks of ribs and a huge bowl of chips! Only 2/8 of us finished it they were so big yet so good! The meat falls from the bones. But it's not just ribs they do- you can pizzas, burgers, pastas. If you want a smaller portion (which is bigger than a normal size portion everywhere) choose the smaller option otherwise, go for the cowboy if you're really feeling it. The staff are brilliant and the chefs are great- they have an open kitchen and you can watch them cook if you can keep your eyes off the cabaret dancers who normally do a 15minute show around 8.30-9.00. This place is really good for special occasions too!",,
"We visited Fat Mama's this evening and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Hubby had Hunters Chicken and I had Geronimo Chilli Chicken. Both came with fries and a salad garnish. We both enjoyed the mains very much. Think American Diner style food and you won't go too far wrong. Hubby had Pacino's Kiss for dessert (trifle) and I had Godfather Chocolate Cake. Big portions once again and good tasty fodder.  Every 15 minutes or so, we were treated to 3 young ladies singing or dancing (or both) and then there was a cabaret - the Fat Mama's dancers plus a young man. Not Hubby's cup of tea at all but I thought it was good. Think cross between cruise ship entertainment, Britain's Got Talent, X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. Very pleasant.  Would we go there again? Absolutely.  A big thank you to the staff for an enjoyable evening x",,
Carbonara had too much cream however they were kind enough not to charge for that after I complained. Everything else was great.,,
Ive visited this place 4 times now and everyone i have taken here has loved it. It's reasonably prices and offers meals in a small or large portion (to us that means large or extra large) their cocktails are amazing aswell as desserts! Every Time we have been its worked out an average of €50 per couple and we usually have starters mains cocktails and desserts.,,
Food poor potatoe skins hard and poor quality four mushrooms as a starter expensive Over priced paying for entertainment,,
"Came here whilst on holiday for a friends wedding and it didn't disappoint. A warm welcome to all 28 of us all. We was promptly shown to our 2 tables which had been reserved for us. Our drinks order was taken whilst we feasted over the superb Italian and American food menus. There was plenty of mouth watering options on both menus. Once everyone had decided what they wanted service was prompt and with a smile. Both courses was really filling and delicious.  There was also the entertainment that was really good and made the bride and groom to be happy with a rendition of ""we're getting married in the morning""  If they opened a restaurant in Preston I'd be a regular it's that good :-)",,
"We visited this restaurant because various friends recommended it, and we were not disappointed it was absolutely fantastic. We went with family on the 19th of June the staff were lovely and attentive and a credit to the restaurant.Our meal started with my daughter Laura and myself sharing vegi potato skins which were gorgeous and I can't recommend enough, my husband Darren and our friend Jane had the stuffed mushrooms which looked and smelled beautiful. The mains consisted of chicken fajitas and cowboy burgers, my husband and I had the cowboy burgers which were quality as well as quantity. Jane and Laura had the fajitas which smelt fantastic and both of them said they were perfect and the best ones they have ever tasted. Unfortunately we didn't have room for desert I only wish we did. So if your ever in Paphos give Fat Mamas a go you won't regret it. And a special thank you to Alex we were really glad we met you and hope Jimmy didn't give you too much of an ear bashing it was a blast. If we ever come back to Paphos Fat Mamas will be definitely on our list to revisit.",,
"what a fantastic night with friends, the food fab and lots of it, the entertainment awesome, Stavros Flattley was there the night we went, great for families or couple",,
Went with my family and we ordered various things from the menu and all were excellent. Very reasonable prices Beowulf highly recommend this place.,,
"Great atmosphere, massive portions and good entertainment.    The Italian / American fusion menus give a great deal of choice and you can mix and match from both.    I went to order the 'cowboy' portion of ribs and thankfully the waitress talked me out of it, as the standard portion was monstrous... Some of the best ribs I've had!",,
"WE visited this restaurant on 12th April,birthday celebration with friends.The food was beautiful,cooked to perfection and tasted gorgeous,the steak was to die for and deserts not for dieters.Staff could not do enough for you,exceptional table service,Maria in particular went out of her way to help me spring a surprise bottle of bubbly on our friends. Fun entertainment also.The price of all meals and drinks very reasonable and something to suit all budgets.We will be back there next year!!  This eaterie not to be missed.Well worth the visit.cannot fault food or staff.",,
"We had an amazing meal here on our first night ! Food was great, service was brilliant, dancing was a bit cringe. Would definitely return if we visit Cyprus again !",,
"Great food, very good entertainment excellent staff not to expensive, wine not cheep, over looking the buzzy road",,
"Fat mamas is known for their massive portions, delicious comfort food and light hearted entertainment!    There is so much to choose from (they have 2 menus) ranging from Italian/Mexican/American/grilled dishes. They do also give you the option to choose whether you want the smaller or larger portion - the small portion is still more than enough!    Every 15-30 mins or so, the entertainers come out and sing/dance and at 9pm they put on a little 'cabaret' show which won't blow you away but is entertaining nonetheless.    Unfortunately, at the moment there is a lot of roadworks going on along the road which ruins the look and feel of the area.    However if you are looking for some fun and great food either as a family or for friends, this is a good place to go!",,
Good food. Choice from 2 menus. Lots of friendly staff including Fat Mama & her friend called Willy. Not for those who want a quiet night though good entertainment especially if its for a special ocassion,,
A lot of road works going on so crossing road night mare food is lovely and atmosphere but you can smell sewerage round that area but nice change for an evening.,,
Never had a meal beforein a restaurant while being entertained - fantastic experience. Food comes in huge protions and is fantatstic. I would recommend it to everyone.,,
Number one place on TripAdvisor does all kind of food Italian and American. Be warned portions are large!!,,
It was a great evening with delicious food and dance. Strongly recommend to visit it when hungry as portion sizes are quite large. Staff is very friendly and attentive.,,
"My wife and I have been to Fat Mama's a couple of times during our holidays. Great place if you are hungry and like big portions, the food though is average, there are better places to eat.",,
"Fab visit, a couple of days before our wedding day, staff were great, a really good fun evening with lovely food, they made us feel very special ! We will be back 😉",,
"The platter to share as starter fed three of us! Steak tender and really good portions. Live entertainment, really good night",,
We found this place after jurt areiving in Paphos and staying in the apartments over the road.  Very entertaining with the girls up singing and dancing virtually every couple of minutes.  Face painting for the kids too.  Food was typical american burgers but very nice. We didnt have anything off the Italian menu or desserts so cant comment on them.,,
Had a really good visit me and the missus shared potato skins was a massive portion so glad we only ordered one between us. We had burgers and they were great massive portions too . Would recommend to anyone very well priced and big choice of menu,,
when we arrived at the restaurant the queue to get in was quite long. we waited about 15 mins to get a table. once in we felt uncomfortable as everything happens so fast. the staff put on a good show & the food is good but we felt rushed as people were still queuing to get in.i would think twice about returning there as i like a nice slow evening meal.,,
"we visited last July as a group of 15, the food was gorgeous, service was great and entertainment the kids loved. would definitely come back and recommend.",,
"we ate here twice in a week, i have to say it was the nicest steak i have ever eaten!!    The food and service is lovely and the small entertainment bits they do were great. On our second night stavros flately did a small show and it was very good.    I would eat here again when i am next in Paphos.",,
"Great meal with high taste, choice and very happy friendly staff. With free entertainment as well. Superb.",,
Good food for a good price portions are massive great place to visit staff friendly and good dancers for entertainment,,
Excellent trip for our granddaughter - there is entertainment going on periodically during the meal and the singers sang a special Happy Birthday,,
"Had a couple of nights at fat mama's enjoyed the food, cocktails and the show. We had a couple on their honeymoon and a 50th birthday and they gave us a free cocktail and the showgirls presented it. Both nights there were great!",,
"Went for a quiet meal with my boyfriend and ordered the chicken fajitas. The food was fast, fresh and tasty but just a bit too big (a portion of chips with fajitas???). Cabaret interludes were a bit too frequent for my liking but good for families with young kids. If you hate the birthday song at frankie and benneys - AVOID!",,
I visited fat mamas 3 times whilst in Paphos the food and service is amazing . 2 menus Italian and American style ribs steaks,,
"Hi Alex, thank you so much for the amazing meals we had on several occasions throughout our week stay. Fantastic atmosphere, excellent staff and the food omg mouth watering.  Well worth the money and more, if you are in paphos make time to come here you will never be disappointed, Amazing!",,
All I can say is you won't leave hungry Portions are huge and the food delicious Great atmosphere This is a must place to eat out on your holiday,,
"The food was amazing..... And plenty of it!  All the staff were happy and helpful - with a sense of humour, and the free entertainment was the icing in the cake.  A really good fun night out.  Oh and the chocolate fudge cake was pretty awesome",,
Food was spot on and plenty of it never ate so many ribs staff were polite and friendly and the entertainment kept the little one entertained spot on I would defiantly eat there again,,
"Had a great time with my family. Food is top rate, more than you could want to eat. Be prepared to stay a few hours to and enjoy the fun. I had the ribs. Chose the small portion and barely finished, god help anyone choosing the large portion. Great value for money as well.",,
"We had a great time at Fat Mama's , the atmosphere was great and the food even better and for the steaks and pastas we have been back several times for our evening meals.",,
"This restaurant was so good we went here twice! Loads to choose from on the menu, they even do small portions which are still huge! One of the best burgers I've ever had, the restaurant even had a bit entertainment on while dining, a singer and a group of dancers. Definitely worth the visit!",,
Had a lovely meal at fat mama's food was lovely. Me and my partner had pizza and pasta both which were good. They had good deals on with the drinks which meant it wasn't as expensive. Would visit again.,,
"We have been to Paphos 3 times and visited Fat Mamas each time. Excellent food..best steaks we have had!! The entertainment is great. Firstly the children are entertained and the atmosphere really good. The dancers are really talented and make such a fuss of clients celebrating special occasions like anniversaries and birthdays! The service by staff is of a very high standard and the friendly waitress and happy smiling faces especially Megan,  makes Fat Mamas well worth visiting xx enjoy!",,
this is a must visit whilst in paphos .we went for a meal for our wedding anniversary and got serenaded and a free small bottle of champagne . the food is great starters we had nachos and couldnt eat it all there was so much followed by steaks cooked to perfection .something on the menu for all tastes .,,
"This was one of my best eating experiences. There are two menus to choose from - an Italian and american one from which you can mix and match. I couldn't decide between the garlic bread and bbq chicken wings so I shared with one of my friends. This consisted of 4 large and soft garlic bread pieces and 8-10 wings with 2 large dips (BBQ and a chilli tomato).  I ordered a spicy burger which came with salad and fries. My friends ordered ribs (small) - the portion was equivalent to a full rack back in england. I finished my massive portion, my friends left with doggy boxes. I couldn't resist the desert menu. I got the dark chocolate cake slice which was served with a scoop of ice cream and cream, drizzled in chocolate. The cake was triple a standard size, it was moist and so tasty. There was a little show, with Irish dancing, a bit of Beyonce etc. Not really my thing, but hey! There were birthdays and anniversaries, a group of staff arrived at said tables singing happy birthday etc and presenting a free drink. In short I loved this place, I loved the food, I loved the service. I loved the massive portions. I would definitely recommend. There is something for everyone.",,
What fun we are in Cyprus for a wedding and our hosts organized diner here. Omg almost every table had a birthday anniversary or something! The entertainment is well fun executed with flare vigor and even the grumpiest guests can't not join in . Then there is the food !!!! Omg so much so tasty where do u start :),,
What a shame that this restaurant is right next to a very busy road so you get to enjoy the traffic fumes from the vehicles passing swiftly by. On top of this the road is currently miles behind schedule so you also now have great for difficulty accessing the site and you'll also get to have dust with everything. Other than this it's a fun place to eat so hopefully when all the improvements have been completed it will return to its basically good fun place to ear even with its cheesy entertainment. Certainly a good place to normally take the kids.,,
Their portions are fairly large and filling. I would recommend getting the normal portion. Their customer service is good. It was an enjoyable experience but I wouldn't visit again,,
"Brilliant restaurant Alex and staff fantastic, the food is to die for huge portions 100% value for money loved it you have to go there",,
Brilliant restaurant with lovely staff. The portions are massive. Definitely going back this year 10/10,,
Visted 2 nights! Dancing and singing was nice! Food good value for money! Always had to be rolled home to the resort :),,
"omg what a fantastic restaurant we had been recommended. the food was fantastic, the atmosphere is great, the portion sizes are massive would highly recommend not eating all day for this one, we had the shared platter for starters when the food arrived it was like a feast our main courses even selecting a small steak was more than enough, we had the baked cheesecake so light but definately recommend it. the entertainment was brilliant suitable for all ages highly recommend",,
"Food amazing, big portions. Fun lively atmosphere. Prices reasonable.Would definately eat here again",,
"Food is always good with a decent portion, service is excellent especially from the lads 😘 A good range of foods and drinks and nice cocktails, price is reasonable and we will always pay it a visit each time we come to pathos.",,
Ok for tourists with no taste. Food was bland and way overpriced. If you want a conversation forget it. Not recommended.,,
I have been told about fat mamma's by my partner who visited over seventeen years ago so visiting Cyprus it seemed right to pop in well just amazing the starter filled me !!!! And the main course I ordered a large ribs ....... Bloody hell a small pig appeared I only just managed to finish them they were fabulous going back on Friday value for money five stars food quality five stars and when the dancers came out for the wedding party that was there fabulous if you go to pafos you must visit,,
"Large portions - well, huge portions. Could not manage a starter, main and dessert, one course is more than enough, and had to leave most of that. A shocking, unnecessary waste of food - I do hope they consider donating some of it to local charities. Mediocre service, and naff entertainment. Kids would probably find it ok though. My plate had dried food residue left on it. Not tempted to return.",,
"We visited this restuarant twice, it was great, even had our photograph taken twice with Fat Mama and Big Willy, they were great, enjoyed every minute, we will be going back on our next visit to Paphos.",,
I have eaten at fat mamas on a number of occasions and have never been let down once. From being greeted by their friendly staff to leaving the service is amazing. There is a full range menu that leaves your mouth watering just reading it. Throughout the evening there is various dance shows to keep everyone entertained. I would highly recommend the the ribs. When I next travel back to paphos I will make sure I visit Alex and Cathy at this amazing restaurant.,,
"Over the week we ate here 4 times the entertainment was really good after the birthday & wedding anniversary songs & sparkling drinks , the menu was so varied we had something different every nite worth it value for money , so pleased they offered smaller plates",,
"We had a wonderful meal on the first night we spent in Paphos......so much so we had another visit during our week stay on the island. The choice of food is wide and varied.....something for everyone.  The waiting staff were very atentative and nothing was too much trouble. The food itself was excellent....great value and beautifully presented.....compliments to the chef.  The entertainment in the restaurant made for a very lively evening.....a visit is a must. We will see you again in October. Helena, Nolan and Barbara. Xxx",,
We visited fat mamas while on holiday in Pafos very large portions and good family entertainment 😀 families with children will love this place 3-),,
Food was top.. Cabaret was a little dated and unorganised to say the least. It was that bad it was funny. Waitress was very attentive and lovely. If it wasn't for the noise would of given in 5 stars. Cocktails are the star of the show :),,
"Had a meal here with the wife. Was good food not amazing and good price.    Good variety of drinks and food.    Location is on tombs of kings road so easy to find. If you are in paphos centre or coral bay a car is required or a taxi. Can not walk it in my opinion.    |Overall it was a pleasant all round meal which I felt relaxed and comfortable. I gave it a 4 for this reason.    If you are a foodie do your research to find authentic tavernas and mezes while in Cyprus , I love the half kebabs.",,
"Visited here after last eating here 17 years ago. I was not disappointed. It was as fabulous as I remember. Food was superb, huge portions so choose wisely. Staff were friendly and attentive, made you feel like old friends. We've booked again for Friday!",,
"Having been recommended this restaurant by friends we thought we would try it.    The drinks and food menu is good with very much a wide variety on offer.    The restaurant is always busy and popular and there is enough staff to cope during busy times.    Every so often the music will come on and the dancing girls will come out to entertain everyone which is great.    However I contacted the restaurant prior to my visit to arrange something special for our last evening in Paphos for my girlfriend.    I wanted to propose and make it special as I had heard the restaurant can do that.  Well they forgot and I ended up going back to the hotel and catching sunset on the veranda.  It was very romantic but I had planned this for a long time and obviously I couldn't get a spare minute to have a quiet word as my girlfriend was there.  Disappointed yes but I couldn't fault the food, drink and entertainment.    I would go back for those reasons.",,
"If you serve a little bit of everything you can't be excellent at anything! Spaghetti served with baked potato, the sauce too rich and basically food to get you stuffed but not really tasty. Not for high expectations. Surroundings are terrible which is not really their fault but looking across the street gives you a depression. . The staff are doing their best.",,
"What an amazing restaurant. The food, the atmosphere and most importantly the staff are top of the range. Me and my family had a variety of food from the menus and each and every meal was fantastically presented and tasted amazing. The staff are warm and friendly and make you feel at home and at ease. They are in no rush to get you out like most places down tomb of the kings and the owner even pulls his weight and is a very down to earth bloke! We had a waitress called Megan and she was ever so chatty and friendly and went totally out of her way to give us the best service. They are all well presented. The performances from the dancers are lovely and helps keep the children entertained aswell which is a bonus! Over all one the best restaurants in the area. Great value for money and your made to feel so at home and like a vip in the stylish decor!! The best steak on the island! Well done fat mammas!!",,
Excellent restaurant very clean Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The food was great had a peppercorn steak cooked just how I like it literally melted in my mouth and the cheesecake is just heaven. Plus an added bonus of entertainment on its a bit cheesy but it adds to the ambience of the place Definitely worth a visit,,
Went here with two friends for tea. Friendly helpful staff. The food was delicious but make sure your hungry as the portions are huge! Worth the money tho. Very reasonably priced,,
"Fat Mama's is - to put it mildly - a lively place to eat. The food is good, there's plenty of it and it's reasonably priced. But you don't go there just for the food. You go for the crazy and chaotic atmosphere, the excellent seemingly spontaneous entertainment and to marvel at the sheer number of birthdays that are celebrated. When you arrive, be sure to tell the staff that one of your group or family is celebrating a birthday. The fact that is's not true is part of the fun. At some point in the evening, a troupe of staff will arrive at your table singing happy birthday and generally behaving as it were true. No presents, of course, but you get to wear some interesting head-gear.",,
Excellent place with generous portions of good food and friendly staff as well as bits of entertainment every so often. Look out for the very smiley waitress Megan who took time out to chat with us in between serving and clearly loves her job. This place is definitely worth going to at least one night while you are here.,,
"We went to Fat Mama's on the recommendation of our tour rep and my cousin.    In fairness, it does seem to enjoy a good reputation, so our cautious review might say more about us than it does the restaurant.    The menu is extensive and looks amazing, but the food wasn't quite as appetising as the photos and description.    My wife had a cocktail (sex on the beach) which seemed to have been coloured by using Vimto. She hates Vimto so that wasn't best ever.    There was regular impromptu entertainment by singing girls. Not the best voices and it just seemed like cheap, tacky entertainment, geared up to drag in the typical Brit abroad.    The atmosphere was loud, OTT celebration for the sake of it. We prefer something a little more rustic and traditional.    This will be the perfect place for many people. It wasn't offensive, just not our cup of Darjeeling.",,
"Second time going here and would've lost my mind if I missed it, only opened for the season the day before we left, food is ridiculously tasty and portions are generous, the entertainment is just right and they have certainly found a great gimmick here, make a point of going or your trip to Paphos has been wasted!!",,
"The main thing I have missed about living in Cyprus is Fat Mamas. The food is amazing, huge portions too. The service is second to none. The entertainment really makes it a fun evening for all.",,
What can I say food absolutely fantastic 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Staff absolutely fantastic 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Deserts to make you feel like you died and gone to heaven . Stop waisting anymore time reading how good this place is and get your bum down there and see for yourself. Go on you better hurry up them tables get full very quickly. So remember 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ night out with the family without the 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ bill at the end. Prices are very good especially with the portion sizes.,,
Was average American style food with cheesy entertainment in a hit and miss location. Even the kids weren't impressed.,,
Me and my Fiancé visited this restaurant back in June 2015 as we had been recommended it my a friend. The restaurant is lovely with a cosy feel. There is an inside and outside and we sat outside to take advantage of the weather. It was very busy so I doubt we would have had a seat inside anyway! We were served straight away and the meals were HUGE and delicious. I would definitely recommend visiting this restaurant when you're in Paphos! TIP - DO NOT EAT A LOT BEFORE COMING HERE AS YOU WILL BE FULL.,,
Good food. Lively staff. Plenty of things on the menu. Music a bit too loud. Clean and fresh. Enjoy!,,
Well fantastic Gradchildren loved the shows and the dancers while your having your food great staff good food and so much of it we will be there again this year in june july,,
"Went her while we were staying in Paphos for a change the food, atmosphere and the price for our meal was all great. My daughter loved the entertainment",,
"Tried this out for my evening meal and found it very pleasant,with excellent service with cabaret show thrown in which in the early evening is aimed at the kids,all round I found it very favourable.",,
"I visit this restaurant every year usually with my daughters when they visit from the UK fro holidays. The food is always excellent and plentiful. Thankfully they offer a half portion on most dishes which is usually enough to fill the most hearty appetite but not to worry if you cannot finish your meal, they are happy to box the rest for you to enjoy later.  Also included during your meal is free entertainment featuring dancers and singers which adds to the experience. Well recommended for a visit when you are next in Paphos",,
"This is a place for a fun night and if you have a special event to celebrate like a birthday or anniversary be sure to celebrate it here. They have music playing all night, and every so often the music will change and a group of dancers will come out and perform and then they will make their way to one of the tables where they have been informed before hand that someone is celebrating a birthday etc. and present them with a cake or drink, and this goes on all through the evening, also for the kids there is face painting and they can have their photo's taken with Fat Mama & Sizzling Willy",,
"The best restaurant i'v been in Paphos! Very good foot and barbeque very nice cocktails, helpfull ,very nice staff and frendly. Excellent show!!",,
"Omg loved it here, food amazing and so much entertainment while eating. Recommend it to everyone and decently priced too. So wish we had fat mamas here in England.",,
"visited here for dinner when on holiday, food was amazing with very large portions, service was really good will make sure if i return to paphos i will definitely visit again",,
"In paphos to get married last October, we had guests staying in the same area as fat mamas so went twice with different groups. We had recommended fat mamas as we had been there several times over the years, I'm so glad to say we were not disappointed!  As always, the staff were friendly and attentive and the food was perfectly cooked, well presented and plentiful. The mini shows displayed by the entertainment team are always fun and the kids loved them!  Great place for steaks, ribs and wraps, all huge!!  We will back when we return to Cyprus!",,
We tried this place on word of mouth. It seemed to the four of us they were more for drinkers then soft drinks.,,
"Already been before so I knew what it was like, that's why I returned, the food is absolutely amazing and is an alright price, we went when it was buy one get one free on cocktails and we drank so many! they were delicious! the food is amazing and it gets very busy so make sure you book before visiting!",,
We took my sister and her husband here we found it very enjoyable .we would definitely recommend it to anyone. The whole experience was good .the staff were very good and nothing was too much trouble.,,
We had a great meal here biggest pizza and steaks (my nephew had a steak on a large plate and then another large plate for his chips and vegs,,
"Visited last year had the fillet steak fantastic cooked to perfection. The kids had the smaller fillet steak rare they loved, it again cooked to perfection. Coming back in July can't wait",,
"We went along to this restaurant on recommendation. The place is lively and ideal for families with a floor-show thrown in!    Portion sizes are huge and the food is pretty good. This is not a small place and is very busy, but the kids will probably love it!",,
People queue to get in here. The food is plentiful but average at best. Your expected not to stay long after eating. Kids love it cos they are entertained Ok if you like fast food joints,,
"This is well worth a visit whenever you are in Paphos. The pizzas are beautiful, however, the cabaret that used to make the night, when you went later in the day, has lost some of its flair, and length. they will still celebrate your birthday with you, but you might as well go in earlier tan you might have done before.",,
"This was the only restaurant that was packed out every night during our stay in October and can't really understand why. Food was ok, portions large, 5minute showtime which was a bit cringe (3 girls singing and doing a little dance routine by restaurant entrance. Waiters birt disorganised - approached by few different waiters asking if we had ordered drinks, food etc.",,
"Fat Mamas is pretty much an institution in Paphos now. It is very popular with tourists as can be seen by the queues so I would advise go early.  They offer live entertainment and the portions of food are well cooked and large, especially the ribs!    In truth, I'd probably give it 3.5 as the service when busy can be a bit slow but I guess that just goes to show how popular it is and they do look after the kids plus you can get excellent food elsewhere.",,
"Went for evening meal and again had steak, service was quite quick considering how busy it was and food was good. The music was enjoyable and not too loud.3 girls did different dance routines, most enjoyable. More of a lively place to eat with friends and family rather than a romantic evening.",,
"went here as 2 couples for a meal out, very pleased service was excellent as was the food even had entertainment on highly recommend",,
"Awesome food, massive meals, good entertainment. Service was a little slow but then it was packed. Either get there early or be prepared to wait",,
"About 20 of us descended on Fat Mama's for a celebration meal and this place runs like clockwork. No delays in ordering or meals being prepared; everyone was served within a few minutes of each other.  The most amazing thing about this place is the amount of food on the plate - portions are HUGE! Many meals are available in large or small sizes - even the small is equal to any other restaurant meal size; the large is enough for any normal human!  But size isn't everything (though it is important); the food was great as well. Fantastic steaks, gorgeous burgers and the Fajitas were every bit as good as mine!  There is even some entertainment - sporadic bits of assorted dancing, singing and even some fire-eating, came and went on the make-shift stage beside the pavement. It all adds up to an enjoyable evening in a great atmosphere with attentive staff who are there to attend to whatever you want.",,
"We were told by friends that this was to go if you are hungry, how right they were.  Service was pretty good and portions large ( suppose that's why it's called fat mamas).  Not to busy when we visited but have been told that that's not always the case, well worthy of a visit something for all tastes.",,
"Nice place with plenty of bars and restaurants in walking distance. The food was way too fattening for me though and the meat didn't seem of a great quality. I do like my dirty food though and I'm not a health freak as such, but I think I put on 2 stone from my meal. Good amount of food and friendly staff with a good atmosphere.",,
The sauce they use on burgers is disgusting. I had to send my food back and order another meal. They say it's bbq sauce but it's vomit worthy. Don't know what it is.,,
Cannot fault this place at all. Fantastic menu great service & atmosphere. Something for everyone. Visited paphos a few times now & always look forward to a trip here.,,
"We have been to Fat Mamma' s quite a few times. On our own, with family and friends. The food is great and you can have smaller meals, which aren't that small, and you can spend as little or as much as you like. The service is great and the entertainment appeals to old and young alike. Every time we pass by, it looks busy. Would definitely recommend it.",,
A fantastic place with mammoth portions!!! Great atmosphere and super service. The ribs are a must and the chicken wings. Highly reccomeneded,,
"Fat Mamas Italian American with cabaret we visited when we were on our honeymoon and wanted to bring our daughter who loved all the singing and dancing. The food was good as was the atmosphere, I’ll always make a visit here when we visit.",,
We have been to Fat mama's each time we have been to paphos and enjoy it a lot - the waiters / waitresses are excellent and the little sketches they do are great -the food is fresh and tastes Devine we always go all inclusive on holiday but eat here at least twice every holiday - keep up the great work,,
Fantastic all round food brilliant staff great. It was that good we went back twice I would recommend the steak or daisy duke burger.,,
Great night at Fat mamas after being recommended this place by our rep. The atmosphere was ace and the food was lovely. We had our photo with the characters for a laugh and the great thing about this place is that no one is bothered and everyone just wants a nice evening. The service was exceptional and it was value for money in a great location to our hotel. Will return for definite next time we come to paphos!,,
Superb food with HUGE portions!! A good choice for a large eater! Very good entertainment for all ages. Very friendly staff,,
We went here for dinner as we were recommended it. However if you have allergies or want something a little different to what the menu says it creates dramas. The food was OK a bit plastic and tasted like a microwave meal. But you get huge portions. Ok for cheap and cheerful,,
"LOvvvvvvvvved the food. i tell you now even the small portions are MASSSIVE, you must go here especially if you have a celebration (they give you a surprise :)",,
"17 of us visited. Variety of food ordered, quick efficient service, reasonably priced. Dancing waitresses, double drinks in happy hour. Would visit again.",,
Saw a few bad reviews about gresy food at this restaurant. Did n't see any of that. All of the family ate here at some time during our stay. No complaints.,,
"Came here as a break away from my all inclusive resort. The entertainment as you dine is good fun!! Was queued out the door but we were not rushed at all. Both shared garlic bread and cheese which was fab, and high has pizzas.  Good value, good service and food and very popular we nearly went back but ran out of time on our trip!!",,
Great night out. We had a lovely meal and the entertainment was great too. Would definitely go back there again!,,
went for 40th had a really good time food was good had entertenment as well staff was friendly as well good night,,
"It say if you want a quiet night don't go there....... Mmmm , understatement methinks.    There were 3 girls ( 20s ) putting on a dance show - they were ok but the staff had this way of screaming , whooping and clapping that's really got on my t**s if you get my drift , the sort who are sprinkled amongst the audience in "" Strictly ""    The food , ok - bit kinda 70s , the service , complete with painted on smiles was ok,    Look it's Ok BUT",,
"I like a big portions but this was out of control! Make sure you are really hungry before you visit!  Food was ok, but size doesn't make up for quality. Quite average.  Service was good. Very attentive. Location on a busy road, and no view.  Great for kids, but not worth the visit for us",,
"Garlic mushrooms excellent!  My hubby had fillet steak which he said was fab, his plate was stacked he couldn't eat it all.  I chose chicken in tomato which mushrooms, garlic and taglietelle, I don't know why I ordered this because I hate chicken with tomatoes. When it arrived there was mounds of it and I thought it was foul, frankly. Someone else would've loved it, but sadly not for me. I also felt totally overpowered by the amount on my plate.",,
Visited with family had an enjoyable meal with a variety of food on offer. Service was excellent as was the entertainment on offer.,,
"Me and my partner visited Fat Mamas after a long day out and it being recommended by a colleague. Upon arrival, it was busy which is usually a good sign. And, to be fair, it was a good start - we were seated and given our beverages in a timely fashion, however, maybe a short sight by us, we were unaware that every ten minutes our conversation would be interrupted by a barrage of 90's music, blasted via a PA system better suited to an SU gig venue. The mains came out in good time, and although some elements were okay, it would appear that fat mamas favour quantity over quality. We left shortly after the full ""cabaret"" show started (as any conversation would be written off). It is also worthwhile to note that the waiters/waitresses took it upon them to help themselves to a tip before giving us any change (leaving us hanging a good ten minutes prior I might add..Maybe in some hope we that would just leave?). As a couple we always like to tip and in this case, would have been happy to do so, with the service and kindness of said waiters/waitresses, however to assume is rather rude and left us feeling a little grumbled.",,
"Both Fat Mama's and Willy's serve excellent food, and ample amounts, I couldn't finish my burger it was so big!!  The quality of the food is very good and prices are reasonable.  The caberet entertainment is a little lame but it would keep the young kids occupied",,
"Every time we visited Paphos and were crossing by Fat Mamas and always there was a big queue waiting to get into the restaurant. This year we decided to go ourselves to find out why. And we were excited. We had reservation for the 1st sitting since we have small kids (otherwise you do not find a table). Even if the restaurant was fully booked we had fast serve and all the waiters were polite. We had burgers (my husband, me and my son) and my daughter had chicken with cheese. May be this is the best burger I ever had. Great, great, great. All of us loved it. Every half an hour there is a small show performing by the waiters with different theme every time. My kids loved it. And the big surprise was when we had the bill. Extremely reasonable prices. We will definitely come again when we visit Paphos. Congratulations again !!!.",,
"Me and my wife have been visiting this restaurant for years now but something just seemed different this time round. The food was still just as delicious (and portions still huge). My wife had the steak which she said was the best she's had in a few years, and I had the cowboy willy burger. Service was ok, a little slow in places. Some staff must be new as seemed a little clueless as to what was going on. The entertainment comes in the form of three young girls, one who we've seen for the past few years (excellent dancer who looks the part) the other two just didn't look as happy or even look like they wanted to be there. That being said we shall still be returning next year. Well worth a visit",,
"Lots of choice,, good value and the meals are big enough for two. Nice place to eat, I would recommend it.",,
"I really enjoyed the Lasagne and the cocktails being fully honest. BUT, there is major room for improvement. Portions are really big, the staff were so friendly. But the entertainment could be worked on and I think it would be better to change the themes each evening and maybe have someone local e.g. a comedian or group of singers. I went past there almost everyday of my one week stay in Paphos and it was the same entertainment, same songs being sang, same jokes being told and if you want a customer to return I don't think they would wish to see the same entertainment. But that's just my opinion and some others may agree or disagree, but like I said just an opinion.",,
The food was not a good quality and entertainment very poor and to top it all the wiaiteress trip the juice off of my husbands meal on his short was very disappoint I now have a pair of shorts that I can hopefully sort out we were even changed full price for our meal,,
Great place to eat with decent food and entertainment throughout your evening to mix it up a little. 2 mascots come out during the evening and pose for photos with you as well. Be aware that all evening they will be doing happy birthday announcements.,,
"We had a meal at Fat mamas in paphos,the meal was nice,but we waited for about an hour to get it,  They were reasonable busy but it seemed to take for ever,and I had to ask the waiter if the cheif had gone home,then the food came promptly  it's not the cheapest but the nice  So I would recommend to try it",,
"Very enjoyable meal at big mamas , portions are very big and tasty. Big mamas has its own dance team who entertain very evening about 9th which is nice to have a bit free entertainment. Staff are very friendly and attentive",,
this restaurant is the best ever the staff put on entertainment and it is very enjoyable the food is the best and plenty of it great value we have eaten here a lot and never had a problem highly recommend this place 7 stars,,
"visited fat mama's for a meal one evening , best tip i can give you, is go there with an apetite, because they are very generous with ,the portions, and actually the food was excellent, the staff were lovely, and it can be a very busy restaurant. would derifitely recommend this place ,, (if yur hungry) ,",,
"Entertainment with your meal makes it fun. Food is good Burgers Ribs Steaks which are all ok. Service can be slow, but you will have to expect this as it is usually full.",,
"We went just to see what it was all about. The food is American / TexMex ( although I had sea bass!). There's a cabaret act, which is entertaining and they make a fuss of anyone celebrating an event (birthday, anniversary and wedding celebrations the night we were there). If you are nearby then go but we wouldn't have eaten there otherwise.",,
Easy to get to on tombs of the kings road. Best to get there before 7pm as it gets very busy. Superb menu choices at reasonable prices. Food a plenty so don't have much before you go. Entertainment very good so join in.,,
Best night of my holiday in here. Excellent food and drink at reasonable prices with friendly efficient staff. The mini cabaret acts are professional and entertaining. Warning - this place gets very busy so advance reservations are recommended,,
"As the title say's, excellent food, excellent service but the entertainment was a bit full on for me. I would go back again, just for the food and friendliness.",,
"Waiters/waitresses friendly.  Large portions,even the smaller portions were large,couldn't finish it(not me).  Strong cocktails (bogof at certain times).  Did not visit till last day on island,wish we'd visited sooner ,would have gone more!  Great price! 3 main meals ,1 side order ,4 cocktails,1 soft drink,approx £26.",,
"My partner and I had a meal at Big Mamas last week after recommendations from friends living in Cyprus. The food was top drawer. I had the biggest piece of fillet steak I've ever eating, cooked to perfection and was absolutely wonderful. My partner had beef fajitas, the potion she had would have fed 3 people with ease and was also perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. We're already planing on returning to Cyprus next year and we'll defiantly be returning to Big Mamas!",,
Ate at this place 2 of the five nights we were there. Amazing selection of food Italian and American huge portions and very yummy. Good entertainment dancing shows at night. Definitely recommend,,
We can never go to Paphos without having at least one meal here. My daughter absolutely loves it. Whatever you order it will be good but be careful the portion sizes are enormous. If you have your eye on a dessert you need to plan ahead and either share a main course or order one of the smaller prtions (which are still large!) . The staff are great and the American cheerleader style and floor shows are fun. Such a good theme I dont know why they don't franchise it and roll it out across the UK.,,
We had pizzas and lasagne all food was great so is the service. To top it all were the small shows all the time and ended up in an cabaret show. Just wonderful evening full of good experience.,,
Wow came here twice for dinner the w/c 5th October enjoyed it and can't wait to return lovely food and love fat mama and cowboy wildly,,
"The food is good. They do different sized portions for those who might be SUPER hungry. The staff put on little shows, and if you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary they will sing to you! Good fun night out, especially with kids, they will enjoy it. Lots to choose from on two menus.",,
When in Phaphos we also visited this restaurant and were not disappointed.    Food was excellent and service and friendliness of staff great..    I knew someone who had lived in Phaphos and she told me to say thanks to the chef when finished therefore we did and the chef and all backroom staff came out to 'thank us'.,,
The food here is great. Big portions and so much to choose from. Added value is the cabaret free every evening. Well priced always busy so be prepared to go a bit earlier for dinner.,,
We only found this restaurant towards the end of our holiday.great atmosphere.staff are brilliant.the food is great and very generous portion I've.,,
Can't fault this restaurant the food is totally mouth watering and as for the portion sizes they are huge .well worth the money we returned 3 times during our stay .you wouldn't be disappointed eating here,,
Well if you want a brash night with more food than you can possibly eat this may suit you down to the ground. The prices were reasonable but I have tasted better. There was a `floor show' and the dance girls worked very hard to entertain but I just felt it was all just a little too much for me. Perhaps it was me on the night but I don't think so. It is obviously popular judging by the numbers using it and I don't know if they were first timers like me or returning for more. Somehow I can't see me going back.,,
"Decided to dine here on 3rd night as alway's ticking over/looking busy,also we had shared a bottle of the house white on the previous evening so new that was good, so had reasonable expectations.  On the 1st evening we dined we arrived in time for buy one get one free on cocktails, only thing is we both ended up with 2 each (I thought one of us could order and the other have the free one, but no you had to have 2 of the same, was ok but went to our heads abit). Service is good & friendly, every night seemed to be someones birthday/hen night/wedding/anniversary etc as we past this place alot to regularly hearing people being serinaded by the entertainment , also they have a nightly visit from Big Willy & Fat Mamma (basically again the entertainment dressed up as these hudge characters who lot's of guest would have there photo's taken with). Good for pulling the punters if you like that kind of thing/s. Overall I would recomend visiting this place either to drink or for food or both, as there is a good buzz about it and you take away with you a different experience. We dined there again later into our holiday, so can't be bad.",,
Visited this restaurant twice whilst on holiday. The first time we didn't book so we had to wait on a table but after having a drink at the bar we were given a table quite quickly. There were 8 of us and on this visit the waitresses got some of our order wrong so we were a bit annoyed but it was rectified. Our meals were very good and the portions were quite large. On our second visit we booked a table and our waiter looked after us very well and our order was correct. The restaurant has entertainment mainly dancers every evening and they are ok. This restaurant was good and worth a visit.,,
"My wife and I ate here a number of times last October and based on our experiences just had to take a family group of 8 when we returned last week. Everything about our night was as good as last year, service, food, entertainment and value for money all top notch. A++++++ all round, we will return again.",,
"Recommended to visit this restaurant and it lived up to all the good comments heard.  Went for wifes birthday I had been on the naughty step all day had forgotten her birthday cards back in London , the service , food the attention from waiters was fantastic best ribs I have ever had anywhere and the surprise of birthday drinks and the entertainment team singing to the wife was great",,
Good food Good Drink Good fun fast polite service and finally Good Price we were entertained and sernaded by 2 energetic girls with there quick change dress to match the song they sang great place to go for an event celebration ie birthday or aniversary.,,
"We ate here 3 times in our 11 night holiday - fab steaks, great entertainment and staff really friendly - if we return to Paphos we will certainly return.",,
After reading reviews we visited the restaurant. The entertainment was the same every evening could be heard from our apartments. Food portions way too much and quite bland to be honest,,
Have been visiting for a number of years and the food is always good and very large portions. The barbecue spare ribs are the best in Paphos! The entertainment is also good for kids and adults alike. Would highly recommend.,,
"Excellent service, fantastic hot food and generous portions even the small portions are large! We made two visits here, i had the veal on first visit and moonshine fillet steak on second visit, to die for, the steak melted in my mouth. You can choose from two menus so great selection. Go early and get an't recommend this place enough. Also has some entertainment in form of dancers.",,
"Great food,excellent service, happy helpful staff.cabaret worth watching. Huge HUGE PORTIONS. Smoking and non smoking, children friendly a must to visit .",,
"We went as a group of 20, two tables of ten. The staff were attentive and polite. The portions are huge and 1 could feed two people. The entertainment was lively and constant. Everyone worked hard in this restaurant.",,
"We visited Fat Mamas during a weeks stay at the louis phaethon a week ago the food was excellent big portions, all the staff were really friendly we do however advise to book as we did for the saturday night as it was full and people were queuing up the entertainment they put on was enjoyable we would definately visit here again.",,
"Big portions, very quick and attentive service and also brill entertainment. Great value for money too .",,
"Excellent food,service and cocktails.got to go again soon. Great deals for early diners. Good position on Tombs of the Kings Road. Can choose food from two menus. Couple of young dancers pop now and again to entertain!",,
"We ate at Fat Mama's twice on a recent visit to Paphos. All the waiters were super attentive and the live entertainment was great although if you don't like loud music and dancing while you are eating, maybe avoid here until after 9pm when the cabaret stops. Great variety on the menu and massive portions! Very tasty food and cocktails. Only criticism would be that we were served courses VERY quickly so could have done with more time to digest....although this is the kind of restaurant it is, very quick turnover and efficient staff! This didn't bother us and we had two great meals. Definitely worth a visit!",,
"Fantastic food and atmosphere , we were in paphos for a week and visited twice , staff were lovely , would definatly recomend",,
the food is to die for I come here every time I'm in Paphos ribs are the best great staff and great entertainment and value for money,,
"A great place to eat with the kids, great staff and food with regular inpromtu little shows. A must for at least 1 visit if your near Paphos.",,
"Great food (huge portions!!) & friendly service, with fun atmosphere & entertainment! Would go back again.",,
"What a place. We visited this restaurant twice on our fortnight visit. We enjoyed the first time for a birthday celebration, we went back for an anniversary celebration the following week. Both times we had excellent service, great food and good entertainment. The staff are a true credit to this restaurant.",,
We went here as a group of 28 but booked prior as we knew how busy it got. Service was good and food was delicious. Very large portions. Good entertainment too. Would highly recommend.,,
"Lasagne, ribs, steak and burger was very nice. I can eat a lot but I shared a starter and a side and could not Finnish the lasagne! Got a take away bag and had it for breakfast. Food may not be very fancy but tastes great. Entertainment and staff where excellent. Ate there twice and would happily go back. This is a must if your in Paphos, Cyprus.",,
"As a family including grandson aged 14 went here expecting good food and entertainment, unfortunately that wasn't the case. All I could taste was garlic and whilst I use garlic myself to flavor food that was all I could taste on my carbonara. It was so overloaded I sent it back and I have only once ever sent food back and that was because the meat was burnt! My grandson had the same problem and ate just one slice of his pizza. I felt so sickly the waitress asked if she could get me something to settle my stomach and she would see about doing something on the bill. Had water, my grandson was still hungry I'd lost my appetite so we left. Two meals sent back no discount on bill feeling sickly so from afar entertainment looked great up close food was awful, no management staff came to see if could replace grandsons food, a popular place but not sure given all we saw that it's a place people go back to. Going to live in cyprus in the not too distant future this place is definitely on our places not to go. Shame expected more, is it like here in amsterdam some tourist places don't really care if you come back,once your in more tourists to fill places?!",,
Great atmosphere and entertainment was quite good also. Food looked good although we didn't eat there.,,
"We love going here. They have great food (huge portions) at reasonable prices and entertainment - which is pretty good considering it is the young staff. We went for the first time on our Honeymoon and they came out to sing to us and gave us a glass of champers, since then we have been back every year for our anniversary. We have just been this last week and they did not disappoint. Fantastic atmosphere, friendly and fun staff.",,
brilliant food and entertainment while you ate. Just watch what you order as even the smaller portions are huge. The waiters are very attentive and friendly. Would recommend the rack of ribs and the carbonara.,,
"Great restaurant, great entertainment, well worth a visit. Good value for money, plenty of choice on menu",,
"Really great, tasty food. Great service and the atmosphere is like no other.    The staff regularly come out and do a short dance acts, especially for those celebrating birthdays.    The restaurant has a very modern, classy feel to it.    Great choice of food, however the large portions I've got to say are very large so if you can't stomach big meals make sure you remember to ask for the half portions which are provided on the menu.    This is a must visit!",,
"The food here is very good, as is the service, but the entertainment spoiled a good meal for me. Most of the clientele seem to enjoy the entertainment but I found it a conversation spoiler as people on all the surrounding tables were shouting at each other rather than talking.",,
"OK - There are no doubt umpteen really nice restaurants we didn't get to but the food & the general atmosphere at Fat Mama's made it the best night we had in Paphos.  The staff were friendly , the food was great , the entertainment was a bonus. The only down side (minor one) was that where our table was located it was difficult to see the acts - a raised ""stage"" would be worth looking into.",,
"We have been to Fat Mamas many times over the last 10 years or so and we even give it 5 stars in a review last year.    However we went in August 2015 and found the customer service to be poor. In my opinion they have become so popular they think they do not have to try and resolve any issues you might have.    We won't go back again, and if it's good steaks, ribs you want, TGI Fridays is just down the road in the shopping mall and the food is better.",,
the best restaurant in paphos and entertainment children very friendly food was brill big portions staff work very hard because its always busy you have to book a table when you go its a must,,
wow what can I say food fantastic staff brilliant plenty of choice on menu make sure you give this a visit well worth it,,
"Always go to Fat Mamas once a year on our holiday. Not really sure why only once though.    The food is very good, I wouldn't call it gourmet but good, honest food. Oh, did I mention the portions are huge? Even the ""small"" versions of the food are bigger than an average person can eat do be warned!    For starter I had prawn cocktail, which was average, nothing exciting but certainly not bad.  For main I had pizza which was nice and thin and chocked full of toppings, enjoyed every minute of it.    For 4 people it came to €61 with drinks and we all left feeling full to the brim.    Oh and don't forget the entertainment, always lots of singing and dancing going on, great fun!",,
"My family and I ate at this restaurant whilst staying in Cyprus in August and it was simply great, great service and perfectly cooked food! I would absolutely recommend paying this place a visit.",,
"Went here after reading reviews of its a good place to go, food was average to be fair and as for the random entertainment, well you'd get better at Butlins - better places around so don't wast eyour time or money on this place!",,
We visited her recently and was pleased with our experience. The staff were very helpful and food was good quality. Huge portions!! The show was also good. Would recommend and will definitely visit again.,,
We had a delicious meal. The service was perfect. Every time we passed there was a line of people waiting for a table.,,
"Goodnight, good food and entertainment. Everyone should eat here once , it is as good as people say. Prefer cypriot food personally ( when in rome)but the italian food is beautiful",,
Excellent staff! Brilliant entertainment! Great choice and taste of food! We ate here and loved it and we would have liked to have eaten here a lot more! Make sure you visit here!,,
We had a meal here last year and the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was excellent. But we had a meal there this year and it was not very nice the food was mediocre one of our party only ate a bit of there meal because it was to spicy ( not stated on the menu ) and they never even asked if there was anything wrong when they collected the plates.,,
"Superb lively restaurant with great choice of food and super sized portions! great value for money, friendly staff, and live entertainment as you eat. We went twice, had two different meals and loved them both.",,
"Our first visit and we were pleasantly surprised. Great food, great value and great entertainment but don't have a starter or you won't be able to finish your main course. The staff are pleasant and a good evening is ensured.",,
Very nice restaurant in Paphos... Friendly attentive staff and nice surroundings. Reasonable prices and huge portions of delicious food.,,
"A full meal whether it is state or Berger it is nice and hot do not leave it late to get in.a little bit of a walk from the beach to get to Fat Mamma's,BUT IT IS WELL WORTH IT.",,
"Top quality food, massive value for money sized portions! Very friendly and attentive staff, with the bonus of very talented Cabaret acts! A definite must visit if staying in paphos!",,
"Great place to go, serving steaks, ribs, burgers, pasta etc. You can choose standard or Mama's portion for a few euros more. I had Mediterranean Chicken which was gorgeous. Every night there are dancers that come to the front of the restaurant and perform, often changing costume in about 30 seconds to do another song. Brilliant.",,
"We hadn't booked but still got a table for two, we ordered the smaller portions but still couldn't finish it, lovely food and service floor show about every 20mins, we're going back next year there will be 9 of us so we will need to book, loved it.",,
"Great night out for a meal and some amateur entertainment. The menu is either American or Italian or a combination of both. We had the nachos, prawn cocktail and shrimp on toast for starters, followed by steaks,all different and all beautifully cooked. Definitely recommended.",,
"PERFECTION. This restaurant will be beyond your expectations. the combination of the quality of food and the quality of the staff is FABULOUS. Alex, the owner, has never met me before, but he was so WELCOMING and full of information. I am determined to come back Alex, so see you next year!",,
"We visited in September, really reasonable price. Lovely food and good entertainment, I would defiantly recommend",,
The portions are huge and that's not an over exaggeration. The food is hot and plentiful and the mojito is fantastic considering I rarely drink. The entertainment is amusing and the way they celebrate people's birthdays is worth a chuckle. The prices aswell are reasonable. Definitely worth a visit and would go again.,,
"The steak was cooked to perfection but the service could be improved,a little slow,excusable in a busy restaurant though,overall thoroughly enjoyable.. :)",,
"Been here for an even meal with a gang of friends, both times we had fantastic food and a great laugh, they cater for large groups we had 30 people! The entertainment was good, not really what I'm into (3 girls dancing to music, with interesting costume changes!) But the food was great and so was the service! Reasonably priced.",,
"Been here every time we come to this Island and this visit was no different to the ones before. Good food, good entertainment and very friendly staff. I had fillet steak which was done to my liking and was very spicy. My wife had the same which again was lovely. As ever the place was full but we did manage to get a table without a booking which was lucky. All in all a pleasant evening so thank you to the staff and management.",,
Fab food very large portions great service we were a large party and all the food came out together very attentive and always checking we were ok. Would recommend without hesitation to anyone to try. You do have to book as it is so popular.,,
"We took our son who is out here on a visit to fat Mama's as it is the one place he wanted to go. The ribs did not disappoint! I had the beef stroganoff and it was delicious, a very generous portion. The waiting staff did their normal entertainment routines, and the cabaret was very good.",,
"We were attracted to this due to the queues every night so we ventured in and joined the queue. When seated after a short wait we were attended to very quickly and drinks brought over, a great selection of food for all tastes.  We both ordered fillet steal but I had the rattlesnake cowboy portion and boy was it hot, the steak for both of us was cooked to perfection but be warned the cowboy portions are enormous.  Good food and drink with entertainment at very reasonable cost.  We will certainly return.",,
This place was recommended by friends the food was in abundance but service was not great. The entertainment was fun at the start but became a little annoying after a while,,
"Before we traveled to Cyprus we read great reviews of Fat Mama's so thought we'd give it a try. We ate here twice during our stay - the first time we sat right near the entrance where the dancers perform at various points in the evening for customers celebrating birthdays, anniversaries etc. It was loud sat here and whilst I loved it if you're looking for a quiet place to sit then that's not it! However if you're after a quiet evening don't go to Fat Mama's! The second time we went we sat a bit further away so you don't have a great view of the performers it is a little quieter.  There's a good selection of food which was delicious and great value. The big portions are huge but with some of the meals you can opt for a smaller portion which is a good idea. Chocolate cake was amazing and cocktails are delicious. They do 2 for 1 deals at certain hours on drinks; the only downside to this is that they bring both drinks out together so if you don't drink the first one fast the other has warmed up nicely! The tables have a glass top so condensation from the drinks makes puddles of water all over, the waitress did wipe it now and then but it would be much easier if they just bought coasters.  Overall we really enjoyed it here that's why we went twice! Highly recommended.",,
"huge portions (even the regular size was huge) great food, entertainment every night, great staff and great atmosphere :O)",,
Very amateur cabaret although the food is very good. The staff are very busy trying to keep everyone happy and the build up to the show is hyped but the actual Cabernet is very wooden and the dancers seemed bored.,,
"Our first night in Cyprus and with fat mammas having good reviews we decided to try it.    Our food was very quickly served, we ordered garlic bread stated which was okay. I had a pasta dish - IT WAS HUGE and I think less than €6 which was very good value for money. Unfortunately it was extremely sweet, it was hard to eat it was that sweet, for a tomato pasta it's not something I would usually expect. My partner had ribs- again it was huge it was two rack of ribs with chips as a side- he also complained the BBQ sauce the ribs were covered in was far too sweet and made it less enjoyable! We would eat here again but make sure to try something sauce-less.    Whilst eating our food there were 3 girls and two boys marking through/reversing some sort of show routine? They were all in rehearsal clothes, didn't look like they were enjoying themselves (especially the guys) it was very awkward, they kept running the same dances because they would get moves wrong- one guy even got really angry he wasn't doing his lift right. Odd whilst trying to enjoy your meal.",,
"We drove past FM's almost every day, saying we must go there before we go home, the queue was always lengthy to get in, so 'it must be good, everyone goes there!!'... One night, whilst looking for somewhere to eat, we noticed no queue, asking for a table for 4, we were seated immediately... great menu choice, burgers are amazing... something for everyone, portions are huge, be warned!!!    Would recommend for families, couples, groups.. we'll be back next year...",,
Went for my daughters birthday. Food and service exceptional. Floor show brilliant.It was the perfect end to a perfect day worth every euro.,,
"We dined out here for a birthday and it was great. The meals were all very tasty, thankfully I chose the smaller option because I struggled to finish that one. The staff are very attentive and the entertainment was good. We had a lovely evening, thank you fat Mamas!",,
"Busy with large food portions and friendly staff. The 'cabaret' girls and their multiple costume changes, individual dances for the customers celebrations and final performance was okay but to be honest felt out of place to me.",,
VERY ENGLISH however we went as our children wanted to see the dancers and singers. Food portions HUGE! If you cannot eat a lot then go for the smaller portion option (lighter dishes). Very good service and good entertainment especially for children. Gets really busy so try and get there before 7.30,,
This pub is mainly for family's good entertainment for kids good food not expensive all in a good night but be early because it gets very busy,,
"Having been there many times over the last eight years, the last visit will be the last Simple as that",,
"Good place to eat with family, specially with kids. My daughter love this place.nice entertainment for kids also kids play zone. Food is really delicious. And big portion. Price reasonable",,
|This is a brilliant restaurant one I would thoroughly recommend. Gets busy after 8pm so expect to wait to be seated but don't give up !! Massive portions so think before ordering starters and main course. This restaurant combines with Willy's burger/rib restaurant next door so you have a choice of two menus at the table - American style food and Italian - brilliant allows your party to choose whatever they want - clever idea. Cabaret most eveninfnsan't speak highly enough of this one,,
"What a fantastic place for a meal out, despite asking for small portions we still got a huge serving, not complaining though the food was great. The staff were helpful and attentive even although they were rushed off their feet.",,
Visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday (8th September). They were extremely welcoming and very friendly. The staff knew a lot about the different dishes that were available. The portions were absolutely massive and my partner had a steak and he said it was the best steak he has ever had. Definitely wouldn't leave that restaurant hungry! The entertainment was excellent and the whole restaurant got involved with a cabaret night.,,
"Me and my girlfriend went here and both picked off different menus (Fat Mamas and Willy's next door are served by the same kitchen, so you can cherry pick from the menus).    We both went for the chicken fajitas which were a huge portion! Word to the wise - get yourself some extra tortillas - you're gonna need them. Only 40 cents for a pack of 3 heated tortillas. For the equivalent of 30 pence, I don't mind paying, but the restaurant must know you're gonna need to get the extras. No chance you;re fitting that much on 3 tortillas.    That, however, is my only grumble. Food was tasty. Random entertainment every 20 minutes in the form of a 3 piece girl group covering britney spears, abba, queen, bruno mars - and then a big cabaret finish.    Good atmosphere, and great food.  Enjoyed it so much, I even drew a pterodactyl picture on the back of my feedback sheet :)",,
Great food with free entertainment the steak was really good with a fantastic desert great night of both food and entertainment at excellent prices.well Recommended,,
"Visited this restaurant as part of a large group and everyone enjoyed the experience.    The food was good, big portions so make sure you are hungry before arriving! Service was quick and attentive also.    Whilst at the restaurant we saw one of the infamous Fat Mamas Dancers shows which we found to be decent but not quite as good as we had heard it would be, still it added to the enjoyable atmosphere.    Overall I and everyone else I spoke to within the party would go again. :)",,
"The food selection was good and the portions were big. I ate there twice. Service was very good, staff were attentive and helpful. There are lots of staff on hand and food is served quickly. There's something for adults and kids alike. On the first night, there was a 'show' which was entertaining. I would happily eat here again should I be staying nearby.",,
"Huuuuuge portions and fantastic food,1million % better than the Iceland of pafos the (rank) rib shack.!!!!! worth the extra €2.50 on the bus or €10 in a taxi to get there.  Hilarious entertainment as well.As I said food portions are huge and that's the small size and good quality..",,
"Over hyped! The show was very average, nothing special at all, not all seats had a good view and the food is generally what you would have a home for tea every night! Would not bother!",,
"Went here with my boyfriend, and we both loved the food. Huge portions, so you won't leave hungry. Great staff, and shows here to. Worth a visit when you're in Paphos.",,
I came here with my family during our stay in Paphos. I would def recommend tje food was lovely and all the staff were really friendly.,,
"Came here as recommended by my sister who lives in Cyprus, I had chick fajitas which were very bland over cooked chicken was not nice at all I wouldn't recommend to get them. I have a friend that visited this restaurant days after me and she said exact same. L other food looked lovely and rest of my family enjoyed there meal",,
"Visited here after the good reviews we'd seen on Trip Advisor and we definitely weren't disappointed! I had the steak with creamy mushroom sauce and shrimps which was one of the best steaks i've had and the sauce was spot on!  Definitely recommend this restaurant as it has something for everyone, and is also great for families with the quirky entertainment.",,
We were all inclusive but we like a look out and we were recommended Fat Mama's. Tbh it was amazing. The staff were quick with ordering ur drinks and very sharp on taking ur food order. If u have a birthday go hear as they come out all singing and dancing with a birthday drink,,
"The entertainment has always been very good here and makes for a great night out. The service has always been excellent too. I used to complain that the food was average and overpriced however, this year it seemed to have improved! I had the mussels for starters which were delicious. For my main I had Allberoni Spaghetti, the waitress recommended the small size which was huge! It was only 5euro. Both courses were absolutely delicious. The Pacino's kiss trifle was very good too. Overall an excellent night and highly recommended. They have even sorted out the queuing situation. Top marks!",,
"We enjoyed the whole experience at Fat Mama's. The food was really tasty, served hot and the entertainment was good (the kids liked it when the caricatures of Fat Mama and Willy came out). The night we visited was particularly busy (was always busy) and luckily we booked a table (recommend you do that or go before 7pm). Service was friendly and helpful but they were a little slow taking orders etc, that didn't worry us as we were happy to just drink and tap our toes to the music. I opted for the small ribs but the portion was huge and I can eat, the large is too much (for me anyway).",,
We thought we'd try this place even though it was not that high on trip adviser  Quite a few holiday makers at our hotel said it was good  We were not disapionted me & my wife had potato skins to start & my daughter had a prawn cocktail  Then we both had a steak which was spot on and my daughter had chicken fajitas which she said was bang on washed down with a bottle of wine & orange fanta costing 88 euros.,,
"Ate here twice, lovely food, bogof at certain times on beers soft drinks,cocktails and mocktails, the portions are massive but nothing over priced, entertainment was good",,
"fat mamas was a fun place to eat ,great food and good entertainment.cocktails buy 1 get 1 free.very popular so sometimes you have to wait for a table ,but well worth it.a great place.",,
"We have lived in Cyprus for 5 years and never been to fat mamas , it was our daughter birthday and she wanted to go for her birthday meal... we booked our table some days before and said it was her birthday.. we arrived on time to our table waiting... Delaney has a birthday song and free drink, our meals were of good size, Food came quite and hot",,
"awful service awful food the ribs were tasteless the waitress very rude,the way the buy a large drink get one free are all brought out together so the second one gets warm and puddles are all over the glass tables..",,
Lovely huge meals would recommend to everyone. Nice touch celebrating anniversarys/weddings/birthdays. Although this can get on your nerves every 5 minutes while your trying to eat.,,
The food here is definitely on the larger portion size so no need for starters. The entertainment from the staff is great with classic up beat songs being performed at set times during the night. Definitely worth a visit if in Paphos.,,
"staff brilliant, for very good, entertainment very good, greeting excellent, easy parking, if you go to Paphos and don't go here its your loss whether your a couple or a large family this place will look after you.",,
"WOW we were a little skeptical as lots of people had recommend this place to us, as described as TGI fridays, which is a bit but the food was always far superior to TGI's good service, exceptional value for money, good service. We had ribs, and I had cannelloni, this is a restaurant that you don't need a starter at!! My canelloni, came in a flan dish, 14inchs across and 1-2 inches deep, and was fantastic.",,
Fabulous food & fun entertainment. Staff were superb & attentive without being pushy. The best steak I have had in a long time!,,
"This is quite a family entertainment restaurant similiar to TGIFridays (with singing Happy Birthday). 3 ladies would suddenly appear at the front of the restaurant and dance to old songs. This was probably entertaining to younger guests however if you are sat at the front like we were it was very loud! There was also a brief appearance from the restaurant mascots.    The food was served hot and were massive portions. Pasta dishes were served with a jacket potatoe and the fajitas came with a bowl of chips! Some meals did have the option of a smaller portion but personally the meals did not need the extra potatoes dish. Overall, good tasty food although we did feel bad leaving so much food.",,
We are here at the moment and have just eaten the best meal since arriving in Paphos a week ago. There are 2 menus to choose from and you can mix and match. Small portions available and they are more than big enough. Great service and great entertainment. Good for all the family. Discount between 5 and 7. We will definitely be back. I think this is the best pasta meal I have ever tasted,,
"The food was excellent and the service was even more so. I also enjoyed some of the entertainment but I think that the music is a bit outdated. For food, I would recommend the pasta carbonara or if your into meat, then try the steak. It's cheap for the quality being around €20.    Dad ..... The entertainment was really pretty good and kept daughter and wife enthralled with all the costume changes. Great night out.",,
"My daughter wanted to eat here every night, the staff were so friendly and the food was great! Very entertaining, always something going on.",,
"We decided to try fat mamas after been told about from a family member. The service was slow and I had to ask several times to order our food. When our main meals arrived, my pasta didn't look like what I ordered. I asked a waiter and then someone came over. The pasta was over powered with lots of tomato and basil and had no sun dried tomatoes as stated in the description. It was like something out of a jar. My husband also ordered a different pasta dish which was bland and tasteless. Nobody came over to ask us how our food was and the customer service was just non existent. Avoid !!!!! Eat in the traditional tavernas or a proper Italian particularly in coral bay - La Vigna!!!",,
"Have been here a number of times. It is great for celebrations as it has live music from the waiters, very lively and entertaining. Have been here several times. It made our friends birthday so memorable.",,
Me and my boyfriend went here a couple of times while we were on holiday. The staff were great and very accommodating as we didn't book either night. The cocktails are delicious as is the food. We ordered a sharing platter to start and it was massive! We couldn't finish that let alone order mains. The ribs are some of the best that we have ever had. The entertainment is a great added bonus. Would definitely recommend and return on our next visit.,,
"Ate here on Sunday 23rd August and have done on previous visits to Paphos, no real complaints about the quality of the food, (although to be honest it does have a ""mass produced"" feel to it) it's actually the quantity I take issue with. Every time we've eaten here at least one of our party (on this visit it was two of us) has failed to finish our main course, and we're not alone judging by other plates we saw being cleared. Since we last visited about 8 years ago the restaurant does appear to have introduced a large/small portion size choice for customers on some dishes. Despite this, my Steak Diane, for example, was served on a huge plate, and whilst the steak was maybe 8oz at most, the rest of the plate area was filled with chips and salad!! My partner had chicken fajitas, where she was given 4 tortillas as part of the dish and then enough chicken fajita mix on a skillet to fill at least 8 to 10 tortillas (extra tortillas available at 40c each!!). My 11 year old had the ""small"" ribs which amounted to two full racks of ribs and a huge plate of chips (the ""large"" amounted to four racks apparently), and was actually apologetic that she couldn't finish more than one rack!!    All in all, while there was nothing wrong with the food as such (although I'd describe the quality as slightly above average at best), we couldn't help but feel it would be better to reduce portion sizes further and perhaps reduce the cost of each meal in line with that.    The amount of overall wastage from the restaurant must be huge, and you can't help but wonder what happens to it.    There is a rather cheesy ""cabaret"" show that you'll either love or loathe (we were neither here nor there about it to be honest ...but were not compelled to stay for all of it if that's any indication). There are also regular ""turns"" throughout the evening where a troupe of girls come out to sing/dance to a song to mark someone's birthday/anniversary etc., whilst a nice touch in some ways, these can actually be quite annoying as they are unannounced and the music is turned up loud for each one making it difficult to carry on whatever conversation you were having. One started as our waitress was taking our order and we hd to shout to make ourselves heard.    All in all, some might see it as a fun place, but for us, as the title says Fat Mama's/Cowboy Willy's is nothing special.",,
Best place for entertainment with food! Food was lovely be careful they can come in quite large portions!!! I advise booking. We booked for 7.30 as we was told it was the latest we could. After 8 it gets busy people queuing for tables ! Fast service though!,,
"Fat Mama's was recommended to us on our recent family holiday to Paphos. We chose burgers, enchiladas and fajitas. Delicious! Massive portions, we chose small portions and some of us still left a little. Great service, great atmosphere and great value for money. Glad we went!",,
"Can't understand why there were queues every night, decided to try it wished we hadn't bothered. Food was ok, service was poor, more like a typical fast food eatery on most retail parks in England.",,
"food was fantastic, best steak my ten year old daughter has ever eaten !!!!! service was very good and the entertainment was very good too.",,
"Busy but well organised , lively entertainment ,huge portions of pretty decent food .it lives up to its reputation , not traditional Cypriot , but a must for tourists looking for a good feed and a fun experience",,
Went to fat mama's for a night out with friends when on holiday in paphos food was good entertainment was good a little bit pricey but well worth a visit .but make sure you book a place as it gets packed out .most nights there's a lot of people waiting,,
"A very good place to eat , service was very good standard of food again very good.Priced slightly on the high side but as in all things in life you get what you pay for.At the time of our visit there was on going entertainment which was very good.Get there early to avoid a queue",,
"We were in paphos and noticed how busy the restaurant was so decided to pop in.. You will not to go for the larger potions the normal size is massive!!! Great food, good service and nice evening entertainment and reasonable prices , well worth a visit.",,
"The service at this restaurant has always been exceptional, we have been coming to Cyprus for over ten years and most times give this place a visit, in ten years it has never dropped its standards on customer service and is yet to be beaten for consistency of food quality and service. Yet again another brilliant evening had",,
"Truly huge portions! Amazing food. Very good selection and choice. Very busy, either book or go early. Fast service and good quality. Had the ribs but a small portion which was a whole rack! A normal portion is 3 racks!!!! Mum had the fillet steak and it was also delicious. The burgers were massive! Peoples faces were a picture when the waitresses put them on the table in front of them. Well worth a visit when in paphos.",,
"Good choice of food and plenty of it, friendly staff understanding your needs and helpful, plus entertainment thrown in.",,
"A good evening of entertainment at Fat Mamas, great for families not really the place to go if you're after a romantic evening! Food is good but not the best I've had but saying that a fun evening.",,
"Myself and my partner stayed in a hotel just down the road, and this was recommended to us by friends- back in England.    We were amazed, the service was perfect, really friendly waiters/waitresses. Entertainment included. Food was wow.. It was so good, easily our favourite place in Paphos, and what shocked us most was the price! It was so cheap to eat here, and the food was pure perfection. It was a lovely, cosy restaurant that definitely had a perfect atmosphere for couples and families. The wifi also came in handy too!    We will be returning if we find ourselves in Paphos again!",,
"We went to Fat Mamas to celebrate our amazing Grandaughters birthday. We took her cake with us, and they all came and made a lovely fuss of her! The food was good, portions were huge!  The staff worked so hard and were truly wonderful!  A great place to experience at least once during a visit to Paphos!",,
We were going to go to TGI's but decided here instead from reading reviews.  Very pleased we booked here as went to TGI's on another occasion and it was average!  We booked a table for 12 (+ highchair) at 7pm for my daughters birthday.  Service was excellent despite being packed out and very busy. Staff all friendly and enthusiastic. They made the kids feel special with sparklers in the drinks & deserts.  Every 5-10 mins dancing/singing girls come running out do a quick number and then go to a table to sing happy birthday etc our daughter also got a free non alcoholic cocktail.  Fat mama & Willy came out for a dance and had photos with the kids & they said there was Caberet later but as we had young kids we left by 10pm.  We took a cake which was given to staff on arrival and they bought it out with the deserts again singing happy birthday and making a fuss of my daughter.  We had such a great night I would def return,,
We visited this restaurant for our evening meal I ordered the ribs and when it came out there was a whole cow laid on my plate massive portion very nice as well. Entertainment was excellent fun for all the family. This place is a must do when in paphos.,,
"Fat Mamas was recommended by our rep and by family who had previously stayed in the area.  We booked a table three nights in advance as whenever we passed by it was queued way down the street! Service was nice and friendly, British waiters probably enhanced the experience slightly as it was easier to communicate and have a joke with them.    There is nothing traditional Cypriot about Fat Mamas. Portions are massive, verging on madness! The food was good but nothing out of this world. The night was enjoyable enough, and we received a free glass of champagne as we were on our honeymoon which was a nice gesture    We planned to sit all night, enjoying the cabaret and having drinks, however we were so full we literally HAD to walk it off.    I wouldn't rush back, mainly because most of the food we were served is in our apartment fridge so we wouldn't need to, (they let you take home anything uneaten) but also because it was nothing that special, although a nice evening none the less.",,
"Amazing food and staff,meals where amazing get good value for money. Definitely recommend this to anyone visiting.",,
Friendly staff. Ok food. Great night out for young families. What you see is what you get! No complaints works well will not blow you away!,,
A very busy popular restaurant. we were taken to the bar whilst waiting for our table which wasn't a long wait. I had Mediterranean chicken with linguine pasta (small portion) which was plenty. my husband had fajitas he also ordered a salad (was huge) which he couldn't eat so they packed it up for us to take away. One son had a steak and the other bolognaise both enjoyable they said. Food good atmosphere lively. Worth a visit.,,
"American food, huge portions, average quality.  The ribs are totally covered in sauce so you can't even taste the meat. The fajitas chicken was a bit burnt and the portion was way too big - also, it is impossible to fit everything in only three pieces. Too much tomato sauce in the nachos, but overall the food was not bad. Very loud. The show is nice.",,
"Was recommended this restaurant by a local taxi driver so we decided to give it a go.  Great atmosphere, lovely food (American and Italian) and large portions. A good selection of cocktails and desserts.  The entertainment was fun and the girls did a great job of singing and dancing.  Extremely popular as people were queuing for a table.  Staff plentiful all very cheerful and pleasant.",,
"Worth the wait if you go with family as some entertainment on and very efficiently run-cleared, cleaned, table set, order taken..... Go for smaller portions- we could not eat even these but were offered to take away if we wanted.",,
"The Food is fabulous, the staff are friendly will be calling again without a doubt. just got to wait until next year",,
Great food good entertainment. Large portions and very tasty. Great night to spend with friends having fun,,
"1st visit: Generous portions, v helpful servers, delicious food, good entertainment. 2nd time: less attentive server who offered no advice about menu choices, Less quality food, still generous portion and good entertainment.",,
"Our 3rd visit in 5years well organised, family entertainment restaurant. We had a nice meal and enjoyed the staff dancers. Well worth letting them know on arrival if your celebrating birthday or anniversary.",,
"Not the place you would go for a traditional Cypriot meal but what a unique experience. I had the ribs, such an enormous portion I struggled to finish, but did. A small portion is twice as large as a TGI portion so beware when ordering as this generosity in portion control seems to apply to the whole menu, they don't skimp. Really good atmosphere and special treatment is dispensed to those celebrating a birthday. Really great waiters and waitresses, would thoroughly recommend for a good fun time out.",,
"Visited with wife and 2 teenagers. There is always a queue to get in but don't be put off, the line moves quickly, we were seated on no time. The entertainment of singing, dancing girls occurs every few minutes in the evening. It's a bit cheesy and not at all Cypriot but it's all part of the experience. You will need a table somewhere close to the entrance to get a good view. The staff were friendly and attentive. The food is American and Mexican and you will not go hungry. The desserts are also better than you will find in most Cypriot style restaurants. Have been to Fat Mama's a few times and would always return.",,
"Excellent night. Great food, large servings, excellent dancers. Defo a place to go when visiting paphos",,
"Popped in here tonight for an early dinner, we knew what the place was like as we had been here last year whilst on holiday  Staff are very friendly and a great menu to choose from, portion sizes are maybe a little big children's spaghetti bolognaise is big enough for an adult, you definitely get good value for money !!  Will be back again !!",,
Brilliant restaurant good food and while u a eating the staff come out to dance to brilliant music we would definitely go back and the bus just stops near by aswell,,
"We were welcomed and taken to our table by very friendly staff. There were 20 of us there for a meal and the service couldn't have been better. Very attentive, nothing was a problem. Wood definitely recommend it to anyone going to Paphos.",,
"Been coming here for years. When the children were small they loved the 'show' ladies dancing & Fat Mamma & Willy photo shoots.  Always spoilt for choice on the extensive menus.  Maybe time for a change... Sewerage smell didn't help at the start of the meal (but TOK road is being constantly dug up) service a little over zealous, food seemed average compared to previous years.",,
"Friendly welcome for families and couples, good service, large portions are really large and a challenge to finish an ideal resturant for any budget",,
"Great food and a really lovely atmosphere, watch wha time you visit though as the place gets so packed later on.......however this shows how good the place is.",,
We went there as a group of 6 and 3 kids and all had food and it was reasonably priced. There was a little bit of a wait between meals and drinks but it was worth it as the food was amazing and the portion size was really big. There was entertainment every 15 mins or so and was really fun for all ages. There is face painting for the kids and fat mama and cowboy willy come for a visit too,,
"We were recommended this restaurant by numerous people, luckily we booked a table because when we arrived there was a queue of around 20 people waiting for tables. The service and the food is just amazing and there is entertainment whilst you eat. We will definitely be returning next time we are in Cyprus.",,
this restaurant has to be one of the best places I have ever eaten at the place always had a great atmosphere dancers singers and all kinds of entertainment going on and above all the choice of food was like I said unbelievable lots of it and absolutely beautiful we would go every other night and you were spoilt for choice we can't wait to go back very highly recommended,,
"Having had amazing dinners at this place around 10 years ago, I was excited to be revisiting. Unfortunately I was slightly disappointed with the meal this time around.  I ordered beef enchilladas described on the menu as filled with minced beef and a salsa sauce however the filling was mostly peppers, onions and kidney beans with very little mince. My husband ordered a steak which was nice but nothing special.    Having said that, the service is great and the cabaret put on by the waiters offers a unique experience that is not available elsewhere in Paphos.",,
"We booked a table at Fat Mamas (incorporating Willy's Rib Ranch) and we were offered a menu for each establishment. Nachos were excellent, we all had a great meal although my chicken fajitas were in lumps not strips, pizza was OK. Ribs were very good and portion size was large so don't be tempted by the ""Sherriff's portion"" unless you have a big appetite.  Entertainment was a bit Karaoke and high kicks but it was free so would keep the kids amused. Busy place but service was good and definitely worth a visit, but maybe not a second.",,
OMG what a night. It was our last night in Paphos and glad we saved the best till last. Entertainment was brilliant. Staff exceptionally helpful and explained everything. Food off the scale and just massive portions.,,
"Fat Mama's was suggested to us by our holiday rep so we investigated and could see how popular it was by the very fact it was full with people waiting outside. We booked a table for the following night as was not disappointed. We had a very nice meal and the Steak Diane I had was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately though, and despite having the small portion, none of us could manage a desert. All the staff were very pleasant and the dancers with their frequent though short performances, helped to make the evening even more enjoyable. The kids especially like meeting Fat Mama and Wicked Willy for a photo.",,
"We had two lovely meals at Fat Mama's during our visit to Paphos, the food was fantastic and we enjoyed the entertainment too. Don't leave it to late to get there though as you may to wait as the restaurant is very popular! Staff all very friendly and welcoming.",,
"Great restaurant! Saved the day for us as we were all inclusive at a hotel up the road and fed up with the food. Fat Mamas is brilliant, the food is fantastic, the staff are very friendly and welcoming and the entertainment is great too! The prices are very reasonable, the portion sixes are huge (even the smaller option) and we wished we'd gone bed & breakfast at our hotel and eaten here every night instead",,
"We were actually sat in traffic on our way somewhere else and for the first time there was no queue so we stopped. We were seated straight away on a tiny table for 4 considering the size of the plates the food came on. The service was great. The entertainment (well thankfully that's not the reason we went) very dated and basically quite embarrassing. We ordered the ribs cos how could we not after reading the reviews and they were ok. No different to anywhere else I've eaten ribs just had way too much sauce on! Hubby said burger was amazing but my daughter found the meat a little too spicy. My son had a pizza (he doesn't eat meat) and said it was delicious. Too much food to finish so the packaged up the leftover pizza & ribs for us to take home which was a nice touch, unfortunately too full for dessert cos they did look great. A nice meal out but not authentic to Cyprus in any way",,
"Looking at the reviews of this restaurant we decided to give it ago. Well definitely wouldn't return although the portion sizes met expections, food was over rated although the restaurant was busy, cabaret was poor and we were seated on a corner table for 7 with children with no clear view to the entertainment. Our teenage children were given colouring pens and crayons, did not go down well and neither did the food.",,
A must visit when you are in Pafos Cyprus Great food and srevice . The entertainment is great too dancing and singing and even a cabaret show,,
Very good food you have to queue some nights to get a seat very busy but I it's worth it. You can book in advance and say it's a special occasion and the waiters perform a short song and dance routine before coming a long to sing a brief song to you,,
Average food Average staff Badly in time dancers coming out into the middle of the floor to celebrate birthdays and then not knowing the name when draping all over the one celebrating embarrassing.Everyone trying to get in I don.t know why other restaurants on either side empty.You might think its something special going in but I must have missed it If you do go in though do not sit near the road as they have a hedge of flowers there that attracts wasps I was pestered for most of my meal by a wasp that would not take get lost for an answer,,
"We went to Fat Mama's because of all the brilliant tripadvisor reviews, they were not wrong! It was simply the best meal of our whole holiday. We got there at about 18:30, by 20:00 it was really busy and a large queue had formed. We were greeted very warmly as soon as we got there and although we were served by several people they were all friendly and were all lovely to the children. The food was outstanding although I would eat too much in the day before going, the portions were huge. We had sharing nachos as a starter, this could have easily been shared between four people! The bill did mount up but you could not complain for the quality of the food, the 10% discount on the bill was a present surprise. My only regret is not going to the restaurant sooner in the holiday because we sure would have gone there again!",,
"Great night out at fat mama's, kids enjoyed this though they were not as impressed with the food as they had been in other eateries, that said there was nothing wrong with it, just wasn't as good as some of the other restaurants we went to. It was our daughters 13th birthday and they did sing happy birthday to here and gave here a complimentary mocktail which was completely u expected, even more unexpected was the 10% discount off the bill and the discount voucher for the water park - would recommend a visit durning your stay",,
We went to Fat Mammas twice during our latest holiday in Paphos.  The portions are large and we thought it was excellent value for money.  Try the Nachos to share for a starter and you won't believe the size of the dish but beware of the chillies (HOT)or you could be ordering loads of water.  Steaks were fantastic.  The only fault we found was that my wife doesn't eat beef so she struggled to find a choice of main coarse  We will definitely return to Mammas when we visit Paphos again next year,,
"Good place to eat But gets Very busy so book if you can, let them know that it's a special occasion and they will do a song and dance routine for you as a surprise.",,
"We have been to Fat Mamas about 7/8 times now and always a hreat overall experience. The food (steaks, burgers, ribs, pizza so) are always excellent. Also, the short bursts of dancing and singing and the visit by Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy just add to the overall enjoyment.",,
The meals come in two sizes so if you want steak you can either have a small steak which is ample for people who don't eat a lot but you can have a larger one and the menu is good with plenty of choice like burgers ribs pastas the garlic bread is amazing,,
"We visited Fat Mamas (a table of 10) for our grandson's birthday bash. The restaurant was extremely busy but the staff coped admirably and were very attentive.    The food was (as usual) good and the portion sizes very generous. I had a small portion of spare ribs which completely filled the plate (couldn't imagine what size plate was needed for the large size).    The entertainment Fat Mama and Big Willy appeared only once to our grandson's disappointment but the other dancers peppered the evening throughout and enhanced the evening.    All the party enjoyed their food orders, for the children (6, 6, 4, and 1) the children's portions were extremely large - one between two would have been adequate. For adults unless a serious eater the small portions are more than sufficient.    This is a unique place. When restaurants nearby are quiet or even empty, Fat Mama's is usually always full and the evening is full on.    Not a place to go if you want a quite tete a tete in the evening but definitely an experience worth savouring.",,
All the good reports are true and a must whilst you are in cyprus.the size of the burgers are insane!!!!,,
"lovely meal and was excellent value for money the steak was fantastic, but you must book in advance or go early as it gets very busy after 7.45.",,
We were recommended by friends to go here however we were disappointed as the food wasn't overly amazing for the high price it was at and the act was not very impressive either.,,
"This is a fun place to visit - large varied menu, definitely something for everyone, we had to queue to get in but it was worth the wait. The live entertainment (included our waiter) was very funny",,
Upon arrival ( 6:45 ) we were welcomed by the very pleasant staff who found are resivation and took us to our table that we asked for promptly. It was brilliant we found a card saying ' buy 1 get 1 free on cocktails and mocktails between 6-7'. There drinks were amazing really tasty full of flavour. When ordering our food it came out 15-25 minutes after ordering which I think is brilliant because of the people that came in later started to order. The make your own pizza is brilliant its full of tasty food you can choose. That is what I had that evening. I also got a tattoo which was and airbrush spider under my wrist that's worked its way through 2 days undamaged. Our favourite part ( I'm speaking about my family and I) was the entertainment don't worry it's usual it's a little late personaly I think there short staffed. Overall it's a place I won't forget and will come back when I revisit Cyprus for the 4th time.,,
Just returned from a two week holiday in Cyprus and went to fat mamas 3 nights of 14. The food portions are well worth the cost and staff are always willing to help. Every night there are the fat mamas dancers who perform various songs in costume and made it an enjoyable night. Totally recommend to anyone!,,
If you're looking for a TGI Friday experience then this is your place. Upon recommendation we queued to get a table. We got a drink at the bar and didn't have to wait long for a table to become available. Service and the food were good.  If you like american diners then we would recommend Fat Mamas.,,
"Visiting Fat mamas really made our holiday! It was an amazing atmosphere, staff are so smart and really friendly and the food... I'm lost for words! Well done for creating the best eaterie in Paphos!",,
"Too busy, food very average, tourist trap and although the dancers tried hard we couldn;t really see them from our back table so bit pointless",,
Great food great entertainment and great service. you should book but well worth the visit. portion sizes are huge,,
Spent 2 weeks in Paphos and we loved this place! We ended up eating here 4 times! My daughter cried when we left. Good menu choice. Great value and good entertainment. Highly recommended!!,,
"Situated on Tomb of Kings Road this appeared to be very popular judging by the queue of people waiting to be seated each evening. Amongst our group we had a steak and another had a burger. Just make sure you're hungry when going to this restaurant because portion sizes are huge but very nice! There's a good atmosphere at this restaurant with entertainment as you eat, if you want a quiet meal don't dine here though. If I had one criticism it would be that it's a little overcrowded but the service is very good, you're certainly not left waiting for your order",,
"Turned up at 6.30 due to the popularity of the restaurant early birds also received a discount.  Was seen to our table and provided with our menus.  Having been told of the large portions,they have a price for small portion and a large portion for every item on the menu.we choose to go small  They are part of willies American diner next door once in they give you a copy of their menu and you can order from both.  Our starters came from willies and shared 1 starter, which did the family it was potato scallops toped with cheese and bacon,  Our main courses came from fat mama's,Mediterranean chicken for the wife and myself and my daughter had a steak cooked perfectly.every now and then a group of young girls come out into the main entrance area and performed a song and dance routine. Does it makes a difference, not sure why but people seem to like it. I have no opinion on this. Prefered taste. Did not upset my evening. Staff were friendly if at times a little manic,good all-round evening I will return, it will have to be early queues can get long waiting times of up to 1\2 hour or so.",,
"Been in Cyprus now for nearly two weeks and not had a bad night out, but this was the best as far as entertainment and food was concerned. Big portions for a very reasonable price and excellent service. Singer and dancers were great too. Family of 5 going back on our last night.",,
"Amazing food, went here twice on a recent trip (got fed up of the basic all inclusive menu at our hotel). Service is quick, staff are friendly and portions sizes are HUGE.",,
"Was a lovely meal, great steaks,sweets and large helpings. Good entertainment and fantastic service and great value for money.",,
This place was always packed and we made short work of the racks of ribs which were very good. During the evening the staff put on a mini show and that was always very good.,,
"The place was packed, I ordered stake my portion was small for €15 for a place on a road with a load of tatty bars and close down premises. Then on came what looked like bad holiday rep trying to entertain ( no need ) what was that all about. Looked in to the kitchens, rows of microwaves.  Not Quality food, served very quickly so couldn't of been cooked from scratch.",,
"Go to this restaurant with family and friends. Cool waiters that are always in good mood and will make sure you get a good experience while you are there. Tell them what you are celebrating and they will treat you special (song, sparklers ..).  Have been here more tha ten times and never diappointed. For those of us that like mexican style food this is the place. Prices are reasonable.  This is not a quiet place - expect entertainment ;)",,
"People say that you can judge a Restaurant by how many people use it, going on that philosophy, this place is excellent, a little Americanised maybe but Wow what a meal. I would really recommend the rack of ribs, but here comes a word of caution...........................keep to the standard serving, unless you have not eaten for a month you wont want the Fat Mama's portion............................infact, go there and try it you wont be disappointed I will guarantee you of that.  Great place to dine.............open air eating, great ambiance really superb menu and food to match.    If your in Cyprus (Pafos) you really do need to try the baby !!!!!",,
"Every loves this place it's just fun! Dinner is burger type, nachos,ribs, fajitas and plenty of it.  We've been coming here for about 10 years and the food is consistent and the shows get better.  The staff are great and are always happy in their work smiles go a long way. We had a waitress from Θεσσαλονίκη and she was great thank you.",,
"Was told by another couple to visit here.  Food was cold, service was rushed due to the shows.  Food was large portions but was not anything special.  Would be better if was with younger children. - quite expensive for what its worth and compared to other restaurants",,
"Excellent place, huge portions and fun service. Highly recommended. If you seat outside in the summer it's hot.. fans don't do much",,
Very nice restaurant with low prices and great show! For the last 4 years is our choice !!! I love their burgers!!!! Great place for kids as well!!!!,,
"love this place!! great value, great service and the food wonderful!!!! It makes you feel you are on holiday ...... go go go !!",,
"It started off so well ... As we were shown to our seats one of the many shows were on. Having been before we shared a starter which wasn't hot but still tasty. As our mains arrived we asked for another drink of which the waiter said ""of course"" only then to realise that we had no cutlery to eat with. Finally we had our cutlery and started to eat. The meals were ok but nothing to shout home about, I think it would have been much better with our drinks which had still not arrived. After asking two more waiters for our drinks and being 3/4 through our meal they finally arrived with no apologies. The same came when we to pay for our meal. They were very quick at collecting our money but again needed to ask 3 times for our receipt and change only to be asked how much we had paid so they could give us our change (we could've said however much and I'm sure they wouldn't have questioned it!) all in all a disappointment both in the meal and the service!",,
"We have just been on holiday to Paphos with our two children and we were recommended to visit here by other people in our complex. The restaurant was full so there was a very brief wait for a table, so it's best to get there earlier rather than later but we didn't have to wait long at all.  There is a choice of an Italian or American menu which took a while to read but the choices were vast. I was unsure whether to order the small or Mama's portion. I went small and I'm so glad - it wasn't small at all rather regular and the large size is humungous!  The dancers and entertainment were very good and made the venue unique. It was the only meal we had where I felt so full (and I didn't finish it!) I could barely move afterwards.  Only downside was there were two things wrong with the bill - my 6 year old was charged for an adult's sized meal and there was another drink we did not have, but that aside it was a wonderful meal in a great restaurant.",,
"Massive portions! Good prices! The queues to get in are justified, I fully recommend the ribs! Cowboy portion if you dare!    And too be honest the kids portions will feed an average adult! But if you want a good meal fast all day and enjoy a blow out meal at fat mamas.",,
Had a great family meal here. Portions are massive & great value for menu. This is a lively venue with entertainment. We were a large table and were given a speedy service. The staff were friendly and honest. I left a case behind and when we telephoned the next day they confirmed it was there and they had it to one side so thank you.,,
"Heard so much about this restaurant felt we should visit. The portion sizes are enormous so you need to go there hungry ! The nachos were the nicest we have ever had ! The rest of the meals were huge but ok ( burgers and steak) entertainment is ok, aimed at families with smaller children and it is quite noisybut good fun !",,
"The food here is amazing and big is size. Great value for money, has a show on every night which is ok but we loved going here!",,
We have ate at fat mamas twice whilst we were on holiday in Paphos. Their portions are MASSIVE!!! But still quite tasty. There is always entertainment/shows on so its not the place to go to have a quiet dinner. But it's child friendly and they have a good selection of food available!,,
"I know that the ""entertaiment"" is primarily aimed at kids, but it does go a bit over the top at times. Even when the dancers are not performing the music is a bit too loud. Saying that the portions are still massive and the food is tasty. Not overpriced. If you have kids you have to go. If you don't have kids, you have to go to see if you can finish the large portions.",,
"We visited Fat Mama's twice during our stay in Paphos. The menu is extensive and includes American style fare and Italian food. We ordered from both menus and non of our party was disappointed, the food was very tasty and the portion size is generous. The staff are friendly and very helpful. There is also a nightly cabaret show with smaller performances aimed at wishing diners ""Happy Birthday"" or some other glad tiding. Overall it has a great atmosphere and terrific food at a very reasonable price - well worth a visit.",,
"In all the times we have been to Paphos we bypassed this restaurant. How wrong were we! Superb food at great prices, go large and you won't be able to move for a week! Excellent entertainment as well.",,
"Great restaurant, great staff, great entertainment, unbelievable good food, great prices, MASSIVE portions.",,
"Major sized portions of pretty good food in a fun show bar. Might not be your first choice for a Saturday night out at home but great family fun for a holiday night out. We've tried the ribs (v v tender), the fillet steak (good meat), nachos, chilli and they've all been good (and big!)  Worth a visit .... But make sure you haven't eaten much during the day :-)",,
"I was with a large party that complained at the end of May. My brother in law had complaints about everything including not wanting to honour the cocktail deal, ridiculously slow service, refusing to do seperate bills for different families etc. While I didnt enjoy these aspects of the night I can forgive a restraunt almost anything if I get a good meal at the end of it!! This wasnt the case my beef stroganoff was the blandest Ive ever had and looking around at all the other meals there wasnt any of them I wanted. Ive been coming here for years and used to view it as a real treat but the last two visits have been very poor both in terms of service and more importantly lack of flavour. Wont be back Im afraid and no longer can recomend.",,
This Is a fantastic restaurant. The food portions are enormous and very reasonably priced. They have entertainment whilst you are eating and the staff are all very friendly. Make sure you visit this restaurant when you go to Paphos. Its a must!!,,
"We passed this restaurant and there was always a queue so felt we should give it a go.Lets start with the positives, there is just one the ribs were tasty and tender.The steak faijtas were tasteless and overloaded with peppers.The burger was very poor quality and swimming in chilli sauce which made it impossible to eat.The early evening entertainment was three girls dressed up in various guises singing out of tune songs and annoyingly loud happy birthdays every 10/15 mins.Two characters dressed in fat mama and Cowboy Willy outfits then sang and were available for photos..Great if you have kids and if you like bland food. but not for us.Didnt stay for the later entertainment.If you want a dining experience this isn,t for you",,
"The place certainly has an atmosphere to it. Not for people who want a quiet dinner out. Entertainment, via a 'floor show' of dancing woman, was provided. A general happy vibe with friendly staff. Food was great value for money with the portions exceeding the 'norm'. The food included American, Mexican and Italian, so something for everyone.",,
We had to come back to this restaurant having been previously 6 years ago and it still didn't disappoint. We arrived just after 6 and was told it was 2 for 1 on cocktails and mocktails which we enjoyed. We were not given a kids menu so didn't realise they had one until after we had eaten but our daughters had the small spaghetti bolognese which was enormous and it didn't even look like they had touched! We also had the enchiladas and seabass which were also huge but delicious. With drinks and garlic bread to start it came to around 45 euro which was well worth the money.,,
"The staff in this restaurant are great, very welcoming and if you needed anything explained about the food a lot of the waitresses and waitors would recommend different flavours on the menu. They also have 2 different menus and you can order small and large portions of most of the dishes.    Entertainment later on in the evening is great. It can be very busy towards the late evening so would definately recommend to try and come or try and reserve a table if there is a large group.",,
"Was a giggle,not fine dining but good food with fun for the kids!! a choice of Italian menu as well as a tex mex menu , was a little on the slow side but was a great atmosphere .",,
This is a popular venue and is busy at lunch and dinner times. The reason is that the food is tasty and the portions are generous. These make it great value for money.    The staff all speak English and on Saturday evening there is a floor show which is fun. It is worth a visit. Would have given 5 stars if the food was hotter when we got it.,,
"Loved the atmosphere from the start. Lively great service good food and big portions , we couldn't clear our plates. If you want somewhere quiet don't go, lots to see too dancers perform most nights and any birthday is celebrated too!",,
"A must to visit here ,great food ,massive portions So go for small option on menu , they also have entertainment whilst your eating ,dancers ,it's really good experience .",,
"food was awful. I have order rips and it was like they boiled it, not grilled. price was not the same as the food they serve. too expensive for the food. I will not go again to the same restaurant.",,
"We stayed in a hotel All inclusive for 10 nights and we must say Fat Mamas was the best food of the hotel. Great customer service, entertainment every night. Great for families with young children, couples and people of all ages.    Go, you wont be dissapointed!",,
Just returned from cyprus and enjoyed a visit to fat mamas massive portions and kids like the entermainment worth the money and enjoyed what food we had,,
First visited fat mamas 7 years ago before we had kids. First visit back since then with 2 children now. We got there early as they do get very busy. Staff made us feel very welcome and were brilliant with the kids. They have a very large selection of both Italian and American food. The wife and kids had pizza which was very good I had a steak which was delicious and very well cooked. It was supposed to be covered in a coke sauce but just tasted like a tomato sauce. Would have had 5 stars but felt the sauce was disappointing and the meal was slightly overpriced,,
"Visited here twice whilst in Cyprus as we couldn't get enough of the beautiful food! Pepper steaks are AMAZING! And so were the fajitas! Lots of choice from the TWO menus - one Italian style the other bbq style. Get 10% discount if you sit before 7 - we found that out the second time. Gets very busy around half 7, fat mama and cowboy willy make an appearance with singing and dancing! There are many dances to watch whilst your eating at there are performers which I thought was ace! I could of easily sat there all night! Absolutely amazing place, best meal I've ever had!!",,
"Fat Mamas is a place not to be missed in Paphos. The food is very good, portions are big so make sure you come hungry. Very friendly and attentive staff.  We come here every time we visit Paphos.  There seems to be entertainment most of the evening, with the girls dancing and singing for any special occasion.  Later in the evening about 9pm they do a floor show with lots of dancing and singing, quite often one or two of the waiters get involved also.  Really good fun and recommend Fat Mamas to anyone.",,
"We have been coming to this restaurant for many years. Our holiday in Paphos would not be the same without a night out at Fat Mamas.  The staff are fabulous, polite, fun loving and fast.  The food arrives very quickly, always piping hot and beautifully presented, tip- massive portions- order a small plate if you don't have a huge appetite.  We always go on a Saturday night, great entertainment.",,
"We are here after reading the reviews and glad we did. The food was great, the portions large and the entertainment was good. It's a must.",,
Fat Mamas is a fabulous restaurant. You are entertained throughout your meal by the girls dancing and around 9 o'clock there is a short caberet (hats off to the girls for dancing in 30+ heat). I would recommend especially for the women that you only order the small portion if it is available as the standard portions are enormous. But as always on both our visits during this holiday the food was fantastic.,,
"Had a family meal, booked a table for 20:00 and was disappointed to find when we arrived to have to wait in the queue with everybody else (who hadn't booked) so waited nearly 20 mins to be seated. Although the place was busy drinks and food orders were taken relatively quickly. Food portions were massive and therefore for us there was a lot of waste. Food was tasty but wouldn't personally be in a great rush to return.",,
"There are two menus to choose from and you can select from both if you wish to. The portions are massive. Waiting staff were very good, and usually the service was pretty quick. We visited a couple of times and the dancers kept everyone entertained with their performances.",,
If you have a huge appetite this is for you u fortunately to commercial for us but having said all that very popular always queues waiting to be seated just not to our taste,,
I absolutely love this place, the food is excellent but beware the portions are huge!! If you are in the restaurant at around 9-9.30 you will be treated to a show from the in-house singers, which is brilliant. This restaurant has a great atmosphere and lovely food.
Good value for big appetites don't be put off by the large Que it goes down quickly. Excellent entertainment,,
The food at this restaurant is awsome. You need to be hungry when you get there. You certainly get your money's worth. The staff are friendly and the night we were there they had dancers performing great night,,
"We were recommended this restaurant by our hotel barman and were not disappointed. Had wings to start and ribs to follow and both were very tasty, particularly the ribs which the portion of you will struggle to finish. Wife had a burger which was good and huge. Kids had pasta and pizza which was probably the worst choice and I'd say average at best.  Service was very good and all waiters/waitresses were polite and attentive.  Whilst eating they also have some very random entertainment and every 15 mins or so, a bunch of girls would burst into song and dance. Not something you'd pay to see but definitely adds to the atmosphere of the place and kids liked it.  Overall, if you are in Paphos id say you have to give this place a go",,
Food is to die for and big portions too cockspatchchicken melts in your mouth and steaks very tender. Good value for families,,
"Had been here before on a previous visit to Cyprus. Staff and service still excellent, portion sizes are massive. Dont eat too much during the day if you are planning to go here for your dinner. Excellent once again and would definitely return!",,
Been here a few times now and me and my family have always enjoyed it good food with massive portions and it's very entertaining well worth a visit,,
After eating here before we went back and yet again the food the service and above all was EXCELLENT were definitely go back again before our holiday ends,,
Best steak i ever tasted and top entertainment meals were really good reasonably priced drinks also very reasonable. Staff were very helpful. I would recommend booking before you go as you don't want to be disappointed.,,
"We visited here twice on our holiday, both times we had to wait in a que (that didn't really bother us as we thought that this was a good sign and that this meant that it would be a good night.) The staff were very friendly and welcoming even though they were working at about 100 mph.  The food comes in humongous portion sizes (so if you're not hungry, don't order a starter or possibly order a smaller amount.)  The entertainment was good on the first night however, we were seated under a speaker so we couldn't hear our selves speak at some points, so i'd recommend asking for a table away from a speaker if you don't want too much disturbance.  The second night that we went to this restaurant, both me and my mum ordered two different burgers, when they came the were loaded with cheese which wasn't supposed to be there, however we did the best we could but the cheese made the burger greasy and the meal that night tasted a little like a fast food restaurant like mcdonalds.  The price was decent, the staff were friendly and based on the first night I give 3*",,
"Great food, more if you have kids as entertainment regular. I would recommend the ribs and the enchiladas.....very tasty indeed.",,
nice food not the queitest of resteraunts. they have entertainment which can be quiet loud. service was good. we had steaks which was very nice.,,
Very slow service. Food average.Would not return as there are so many better places to eat in and around Paphos,,
"It's a few years since we've visited Fat Mama's but on arrival it hadn't seemed to have changed at all! Good welcome and service. We arrived just before 6pm and the waiter pointed out offer of 2 bottles of beer for price of 1 even though offer just about to finish - appreciated. Starters - I had garlic prawns on toast which were delicious, only spoilt by the addition of a hair! I pointed this out to the waiter but little was said. My husband had chicken wings which he enjoyed. Unfortunately the main was very different. I had lasagne which had so much pasta and little sauce. The sauce was not very nice - bitty meat (pork I think) and chunky tomato. They pride themselves on large portions and it would have been better smaller with less pasta! They do offer smaller portions for some dishes but not lasagne. It is one of my favourite dishes and I was very disappointed. I didn't eat much of it at all. My husband had pizza which had a thick chewy base and was incredibly salty! We had planned visit into our holiday as had enjoyed in past. Will not be going again. Shame!",,
"Good food and service,we got in before 7pm as they start to queue up,plus 10% discount before 7pm.Entertainent on and cowboy willy and fat mama,good for the kids",,
What a fab place. Portions are huge better to ask for the half portions. Great to come especially for the children as the entertainment is well worth a visit.,,
"Omg this is worth a night out the food was to die for, and the amount well I couldn't finish my steak",,
We always take time out to eat here when we stay in Paphos.    There is always a queue to get in and it feels more like you are sitting in a show than a restaurant.    There is a wide choice across the two menus but I would say that the quality of food is average rather than anything special but the portions are large.    I had chicken Fahitas which were very bland and lacking in flavour until I asked for some chilli sauce to spice them up.    The kids will love it in here and they make a fuss of you if it's a special occasion but if you are looking for high quality food go elsewhere.,,
"Visited on a recommendation, so glad we did. Service excellent, food wow big portions we had nachos to share for starters very good and did 4 of easily. Main massive would have done 2 of us!. Entertainment while you eat, lovely friendly staff...highly recommend and would go again if I in Paphos",,
"We were told by friends that a must visit when in Pathos was to Fat mammas we arrived and were seated quickly the atmosphere was electric, you could see the food being cooked always a good sign of a top restaurant and then of of a sudden ............entertainment in the form of beautiful dancing girls this went on throughout the evening...............    Now the bad bit ????? we were told that the restaurant had a reputation for large portions and not to order the large portion as you wouldnt be able to finish it, we duly did this and ordered our steaks when they arrived we both were quite surprised to see how small they were and even when we had ordered a starter we were both still hungry and ordered a sweet.........not surprisingly we wondered where the large portion had gone ????? oh well perhaps even Fat Mammas has been bitten by the down turn of business in Cyprus.    Dave....Sue.",,
"Food is great but a bit expensive compared to other places. However staff were very attentive, and portions were so big we had no room for dessert!",,
"This restaurant is one of the best in Paphos. The staff are friendly and are happy to help no matter what. The food is some of the best I have ever tasted and is absolutely huge! The two for one cocktail added an extra touch! The entertainment put on by the staff makes the whole night, I would visit here everyday if I could!",,
We are here purely based in the reviews and how it always looked busy when we passed. Upon arrival we got told it would be a 15min wait we had a little ticket given shown to the bar area and it was 15 mins. Seated at our table we got excellent friendly service and menu advice. We had nachos to share as a starter warned it was large and it was!! We didn't eat all to ensure we had room for our burgers. After 5 mins our main came again good sized portions just about made it through the massive burger and chips. We didn't have room for dessert but both left with a good baby!! With few largers and water bill was around 42euro which I think reasonable. All the time a mini dance show was on to entertain the customers which helped with the atmosphere within the restaurant. Would recommend and would return,,
Very entertaining evening with the dancers putting on a few shows and singing a couple of songs! I came with my boyfriend & the dancers celebrated his birthday by dancing to Club Tropicana then bringing him a free cocktail - very entertaining! The portion sizes are HUGE! I don't think we need our potato skin starters as by the time my fajita main came out I could barely finish it!! Staff are friendly and service is quick. Great for families & fun!,,
"Excellent service, food is amazing, superb atmosphere a must place to visit when in paphos but beware- only go on a empty stomach as you certainly won't be leaving with one :-). 5* all round",,
First time I went to Fat Mama's was about 5 years ago and told everyone how good it was so when I returned on Saturday I was a bit apprehensive but it was even better than I remembered the food was great and the atmosphere was brill too big up to Fat Mama's.,,
We recently attended fat mamas for a large group meal and we left stuffed! We had an amazing dinner and service was great. Couldn't fault the food. We got so much we couldn't finish it all. Our friends were married the day before and they even came over to wish the happy couple their congratulations and a drink of champagne! The fajitas were amazing!,,
"After reading so many decent reviews for Fast Mamas we thought we'd give it a try.    We were ushered to a table outside near the entrance with no option as to where we wanted to sit.  We barely had the drink list when we were asked for our drinks order. I explained we weren't ready to order and the waitress left us. About 30 seconds later another waiter asked for our drinks order. I almost told him where to go but I thought I'd be polite and explained we weren't ready.  After we had time to peruse the menu and the bar list we ordered or drinks and food  The drinks arrived quickly.  When the food arrived it was hot.  My chilli was over spiced. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but spices need to be balanced. The rice was bland and tortilla cups had been dumped on the plate.  My wife and youngest daughter's meals were okay but my eldest daughter's pizza was full of herbs, so much so that she couldn't eat it.  When the waiters arrived to clear the table we were asked if we wanted to take my daughter's pizza away but we said no. I expected them to ask if it had been okay as there was almost the entire pizza left but they didn't appear bothered.    I got the bill and left.    I suppose this restaurant might be okay if you enjoy fast food joints but for a nice meal, forget it.    Needless to say we will never eat here again.",,
they had a fun show with music and dancers. the food was okay and the place looked nice. my kids had fun and it was a night for the whole family,,
The food in fat mammas was excellent good choices and plenty of it. It was always served hot and the staff were always very attentive to each table of diners. We ate there 3 times whilst on holiday and the service and food were excellent everytime,,
Tried this on our recent visit it is on tombs of the kings road open for dinner. The portions were big. Food was nice and they had entertainment on later. It felt Mir of a chain restaurant but I would still consider going again on my next visit out.,,
"Food was average at best.  Everything felt like a rush from start to finish.  The place was very busy but it felt very much like a fast food outlet, not a restaurant.  Despite every table being filled the food still only took about 10 minutes to reach the table, which some people may find to be a good thing but to me it just highlighted the poor quality of the food. There must have been over 20 staff at this place but again it just felt almost like we were on a production line rather than a feeling of being waited on.  If you are looking for a fairly cheap meal with very large portions, very loud entertainment and you're not too bothered about the quality, you will probably enjoy this place. If you're looking for a good quality meal, this is probably not the place for you.",,
"WARNING: Fat Mama's will make you bust a gut! But seriously, this is a fantastic restaurant with a wide choice selection on the menu. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome & nothing is too much trouble for them. The potion sizes are not for the faint hearted & the meals taste great. While worth a visit while in Paphos.",,
Went here on our last night in paphos and we had a super evening ! The food was fantastic lots of choice on the menu and the service was second to none. They even had a cabaret act performing through the evening and were in no rush to see us leave.Wish we had come here on our first night as we would definitely had eaten there a few nights that week.,,
The food is delicious and the portions are huge! Excellent value for money and the staff provide caberet style entertainment throughiut the evening!,,
"We visited Cyprus again this year in July and decided on the last Saturday evening before going home to spend it at ""Fat Mammas"".    The place as always was packed but you got a table quickly and duly soaked up the atmosphere..........sadly a lot of regular faces seem to have left and the cry of ""compliments to the chef was totally missing"" that lat year really set an evening off.    The girls came out dancing but ......oh dear the same routine as last year and a little predictable ??., then the meal arrived and we both thought hmmmmm the portions were definitely smaller and ""Fat Mammas"" are renowned for their large portions in fact i had a sweet something in the past I never needed as the meals were so huge.    All in all its a great night out but something was missing this year but we would still recommend this fab restaurant.",,
"We had a family meal here at the end of June, it was mine and the wife's first time(parents have been many many times) Food and service was top quality, we will definitely be going back whenever we're in Paphos.",,
We were recommended this restaurant and it didn't disappoint we got there about 7-7.30 and didn't have any problem getting a table although it did full up pretty quickly whilst we were there meal was lovely huge portions! My husband had the burger and I had fajitas lovely and filling was very reasonably priced overall a good meal,,
"Fabulous meal with entertainment whilst we ate. Portions are very generous, however you may have to wait a little to get seated.",,
"really good food ,lots of choice ,reasonably priced ,relaxing environment .lots of entertainment during the evening with dancing from staff",,
"Our family loved it here at Fat Mama’s! The food and service was great. They had friendly staff who spoke good English, and the food was presented very nicely. Our favourite part was that there was entertainment through-out the evening while we waited and ate our food. This included dancers (with fire!), a singer, and a caboray act! The performers may not have been world-class but it really didn’t matter as they were still good and were entertaining all the same, especially as we were not expecting any entertainment at all. We went back the next night and they had a different caboray act (same performers), which was just as enjoyable!    We found it interesting that they had 2 different menus that you could choose from, Fat Mama's or Willy's Rib Ranch, providing a variety of food. Our meal for 4, including a bottle of wine, came to just over £50 which we thought was great value!",,
"Staying in Coral Bay and took short bus trip to Fat Mamas. Portions massive...ask for small portions !! As it's early July we didn't need to book but it filled up quickly. Entertainment crap....unless you like young female wannabe's who can't sing, trying to sing !",,
Food OK.  We had fun along with old Brits.  The food was ok.  Prices are ok.  I would like to try the shop next to it. It belongs to the same company.  There was this show with music and a sort of modern variety show.  The kids had fun!  Overall ok!,,
"Me and my husband came here while holidaying in Pafos and thoroughly enjoyed the food and atmosphere.    You do get a choice of a small portion and Mama's portion, the small portion was definitely the right size - especially if you'd like desert after your main meal :-)",,
"This was the only restaurant we visited twice during our holiday. Good size portions (even the small portions are big enough for the average adult), plenty of choice and helpful staff. The floor show comes on at predictable intervals for one or two songs and there is face painting for children.",,
"We visited as a party of 33 for a pre wedding family dinner. Great selection on the menu, reasonably priced, huge portions and friendly service and entertainment throughout the evening. Early sitting recommended if you haven't booked.",,
"Fat Mama's is a fun place to eat! The food is ok, your typical Pizza joint. The staff put on a cabaret for the diners which is fun if you like that sort of thing. It's noisy, wild and great for a hen or stag night celebration or for a daft night out.",,
"Very good restaurant.    We ate here fairly early in the evening but it was already really busy with locals and holiday makers alike.    The food and drinks arrived at our table promptly and the portion sizes were large!!    I had a burger and it was the best burger I've eaten while dining out in a long time!!    They even had entertainment, that wasn't constant so it wasn't a distraction to you eating.    Oh and the price was very reasonable.",,
this restaurant is always busy because it comes recommended it is very good and food we had was lovely but i was dissapointed that there was no big steaks on the menu apart from fillet steak fillet steak or fillet steak lovely if you only like fillet steak.,,
Fat Mama's is what it is. An American style dining restaurant offering italian and american cuisine. The food is of decent quality and the portions large. Service is good and fast. Entertainment is provided in the shape of a song extract and then a jolly 'Happy Birthday' or other announcement for special occasions.,,
Nice food. Nice space. Themed - good overall not really too much bad I can or have to say if being honest.,,
Was recommended by friends to have dinner here and glad we did. We asnt quite early so had no problem getting a table. The restaurant was getting busy whilst we were there.  Staff were very friendly and very accommodating to our little girl. Gave her crayons and a colouring book. The toilets also had baby changing facilities and supplied wipes and nappy bags.  There was loads of food especially the size of the children's meal. I had the ribs and my husband had the steak cooked in Pepsi. Both were really nice. Would recommend,,
The staff and the evening entertainment were great not to mention the food! Such large portions starters enough for four. Highly recommend steak melts in your mouth ask for chips to be crispy peppercorn sauce very tasty,,
"Excelent food, great people, next time I'm in Paphos I'm going back there. Everybody should try it :)",,
"first time we ate here food was average , 2nd time we booked a table , when we arrived there was a queue to get in , we told the manager we had a booking , he confirmed we did , but they don't really take bookings so we would have to join the queue ! as you can imagine not happy he was the one that took our booking ! after much argueing we did get a table after about 20 mins , wish we hadn't bothered as the food this time was awful , over cooked , and tasteless they were rushing to get food out ! we ate at a lot better places than here!",,
"This is a very nice place to eat. The staff are attentive, the food is very good, and there is live entertainment thrown in. It's a lovely place for an evening meal.",,
Family friendly great food very fresh reasonably priced .staff are very polite and friendly loved this place,,
"I passed next to the restaurant several times and seen the queue outside which let me to believe that it might be something really special, turns out is just the same food as in other places  the staff is attentive even thought is busy and the entertainment is ok but the food doesn`t differ very much from the other restaurants nearby",,
"Great food, service excellent, entertainment was OK ... will be back before the week is out,also very good value for money .. keep up the good work guy's",,
Amazing food amazing service lots of different choices and massive portions so if your hungry you won't starve. Would defiantly recommend this place to eat,,
"We were told to go to this restaurant by other people in our hotel. We had to queue to get in. When we got a table it was under a speaker so was very noisy. We had a 19 month old with us and were told they didn't have any high chairs left so we would have to use a cushion on a chair, however they did find one. When the food arrived there was far too much. My granddaughter wouldn't even try as there was so much. Half the portion sizes would be sufficient and possibly a cheaper price as well. The entertainment was ok but very loud and amateurish. Prefer somewhere more Cypriot and wouldn't go here again.",,
The food is out of this world. Small and large portions available but be warned the small portions are not small! Their famous ribs are mouth watering. Everything on the menu is incredible and the prices very good. Just like a large outdoor American diner. The staff are great. Music brilliant with live entertainment while you eat. Great place to celebrate birthday. My grandchildren (and us adults) absolutely loved the place and will be returning.,,
"I went after reading lots of reviews about entertainment as I thought it would be a nice change, the food was lovely and I really enjoyed it.    In terms of entertainment there are 2 dancers that come out every so often and then go to a table who have a birthday (seems a lot of people say it's a birthday for a free drink) at 9pm there is a ""show"" it lasts 10/15 minutes and then that is it, was really disappointed",,
Very average and overpriced compared to its quality.  Staff was very friendly though and pleasant. Although the shop was half empty they will let you wait outside for several minutes to be seated.,,
Just came back from kefolas beach resort while there we visited Fat Mama's fantastic food and service well worth going.,,
An amazing Restaurant with Fantastic Food to suit all tastes and then ---Entertainment too - a lovely place for the very young to Grandparents too!,,
"Not only do you get a great choice on the menu but you get song, dance and fire swinging!! Mix and match from the 2 menus; you won't go hungry. The resident dancers put on a great show and are joined by some of the waiters who also sing and dance. Very welcoming and suitable for children.",,
We went to Fat Mama's twice whilst on a two week holiday in Paphos. The service was excellent and efficient. The waiting staff remembered us on the second visit which we did not expect. The steaks were very succulent and cooked perfectly and good sized portions. There was live singing and dancing and even something for the children when Fat Mama and cowboy Willy came to visit the children and to have their photos taken with these characters. An excellent all round experience,,
"Been coming to this place for last 4 years. Alex the owner so helpful and his staff all very very good. Yes you may have to wait for a table, about ten minutes but it is well worth the wait. Went there twice this year and have booked a table for October. Yes portions are large but hey your on holiday. Caberat not Vegas but what do you expect. We find it all very entertaining washed down with great cocktails.Well done mate to all your team, see you on 31st oct. Larry COYS",,
"Fat Mamas was recommended to us by several people, and to be honest we were quite disappointed. The two menu situation was a bit odd and made it hard to decide what to eat. The cocktails were quite nice and the food wasn't bad, but the portions were excessively big and just made us feel bad about the amount of food that would be wasted. The entertainment would be okay for kids I think but I didn't enjoy it at all and the singing was not the best. We ate at some lovely places in both Paphos and Coral Bay and this was definitely not a highlight.",,
"Food portions here are huge! Don't bother with a starter, or even have a starter as a main.    Quality was ok, but there seems to be more focus on quantity. Hence the name fat mamas    Service was great. Entertainment was fun. People were queuing down the road to get in. A very popular place to eat.",,
"Visited this restaurant on a couple of occasions over the past few years. It's always extremely busy with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The staff provide entertainment (singing and dancing every evening). I'd say it's worth a visit, but not necessarily for the food! It doesn't quite taste as good as it looks. The portions are huge, but it seems to be a case of quantity rather quality. The Spag Bol was a bit watery and pizza gooey and greasy. Fajitas looked and smelled amazing, but lacked flavour. The food is ok, but nothing to rave about.",,
make sure you are hungry before you go. The portions are huge! we could not even eat half of it. there was not a lot of choice on the menu. but you could find something that you liked.,,
"Loved it here, delicious food, great entertainment, good prices, amazing cocktails.. Need I say any more??",,
"Food was OK, starter (canelloni) was hot and tasty, main (burger) was very mediocre i didn't have a dessert.  The place is clean and in a nice location, the staff were polite and efficent.  So what's not to like?  Well for me the constant, so called entertainment.  Wailing wenches, trying desperately to sing when they couldn't hold a tune with a tuning fork in their hand!  If you're under 10 years old this may hold your attention, however more me it was a constant annoyance whilst trying to eat, i would definitely no go back.",,
The staff are friendly upon arrival and the experience keeps getting better all evening. This eatery has got it absolutely right which explains why it's busy each night. They have two menus to choose from and live entertainment..Well done to all the staff and management for making our evening a great one. The food was delicious and we would love to come back and see you x,,
"This seems to be the ""in place"" to eat on the Tomb of The Kings Road. The place was packed every night. We went quite early one night oto get a table and we weren't disapoinnted. A great choice of menu, and a terrific atmosphere with very attentive staff. The food was also superb.",,
"The pasta was nice, we prdered the 'small' sized portions.  The entertain,net is good, especially I guess if you are there for a birthday or engagement.  We felt a bit rushed though, as there's almost always people queuing outside. I put ,y fork down to help feed my two year old and a waiter zoomed over to ask me if old finished eating, even though I still had half a plate of food left!  Most of the singing and dancing entertainment was for when people had announced a birthday, charleston dancers would leap out dancing to fat slams grand slam (bugsy Malone) and the like. My two year old loved it.    I'll say it again, the food was quite nice - I just felt ever so much as if I was on a conveyor belt!",,
Always busy. Always a queue to get in. Good shows....but to be fair not our cup of tea. Good value but far too busy for us but can not complain about the food or price. Just far too busy for us.,,
Good entertainment for kids but over priced stodgy food. I thought it was over-rated to be honest although the rest of our party were impressed and returned on several occasions.,,
"I have been reading some of the comments from previous people that have eaten here, and to be quite honest I can't fathom out what they are wanting from a holiday in Cyprus. If they want ""Fish n Chips"" or the likes they should be somewhere else.  Sorry rant over!  We have been coming to Fat Mama's, as a family, once during our annual Cyprus holiday and have never yet been disappointed by either the service offered, or the food. The portions are large but are easily consumed if you eat sensibly on the day of your visit.  The chefs do an amazing job and create some brilliant tasty meals.  Entertainment is also supplied by the waiters / waitresses to add to an enjoyable evening. With Fat Mama and Cowboy Willie putting in an appearance around about 20:00 which is great for the kids.  All in All I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is visiting Paphos. The queues to get a table tell the story.  And no, I am not on commission.  Tip: If you eat before 19:00 you will receive a 10% discount on your bill.",,
"We ate here recently whilst working locally to paphos. Very good service from the off, we all ordered the enchiladas and as the menu indicated they were huge portions! Can't fault the experience. Will return",,
Visited this place twice and on both occasions the food was fantastic .The service was very quick and food just great you certainly don't leave this place hungry .,,
"Good place to eat with a good menu of mostly burgers , pizza etc but also pasta on a separate menu , very popular place and people queuing at times to get in , has entertainment to , waiters are 100 mile an hour to get you served . Good but typical holiday stuff",,
"We were encouraged by the fact that people were queuing to get a table when other restaurants were fairly quiet. Seating both inside and out, busy atmosphere and dancing girls made a good holiday feel. The food was chosen from either of two menus, Italian or Tex Mex Style. We chose rack of ribs, starter portion between us, followed by Fillet steak, cooked to perfection and served with choice of potatoes for my partner and I had the lasagne. The lasagne portion was huge and we had more than half to take home with us. The lasagne take home did two of us for lunch the following day. Our bill with 1 1 dessert and drinks came to €60. Worth a visit.",,
"first went here 6 years ago and this was the first time since then. We weren't dissapointed, freshly prepared pizza and pasta perfectly cooked. The waitress recommended the small size pasta portion and thank goodness she did, the portion was still pretty big! My son chose the 12 "" pizza with pepperoni, it was lovely and thin and we saw the chef preparing it all from scratch. My husband had the burger (picture) which he thoroughly enjoyed. We all had puddings, beware the crepe is huge but delicious. Staff very attentive without being annoyingly so. Recommend especially if you go early and take advantage of the 2 for 1 drinks and 10% early bird discount. Our meal with 2 drinks each and 2 courses each came to less than 50 euros (3 people).",,
"What a great evening out. This restaurant has everything, great food, great hosts, a cabaret show, all reasonable priced. Spoke with the owner on a recent visit and all you can say about him is "" What a top bloke"". You will not be disappointed with anything when you visit Fat Mama's, so go and have a fantastic night out.",,
"Great meal here, decided to come back the following evening as we were that impressed, food is largely portioned and staff are very polite.",,
"read alot of reviews and the place was very busy upon arrival which says alot as most places quiet. had the enchiladas which were huge! decent staff and dancing girls, will defo come back.",,
"Themed bar with great menus. food was excellent with massive portions. Entertainment was fun, girls dancing and for the kids fat mamma and cowboy willy make an appearance for photo opportunity. Was a bit surprised at its ranking as i expected it to be higher. Couldn't fault it but recognized themed restaurants aren't every bodies taste.",,
"Great food (ribs where probably the best I've ever had), great entertainment and value for money, we would 100% come back.",,
"The food here is fantastic and very generous portions with lots to choose from. Excellent for families too, shows on every night. Very reasonably priced. The staff are great and very knowledgeable about the menu, nothing is too much trouble - a must visit!",,
The food was very good and the staff was fantastic. Very much enjoyed my meal here! Would definitely recommend to others!,,
Fat mammas is a must visit the food is quality  The service is good the dancers are ok lol  The staff right a fuss over my dad for his birthday which he loved the girls done a little birthday dance he's 68 he loved every minute,,
"Excellent range of food of great quality and quantity. Atmosphere was very welcoming and fun and the staff were very polite. In addition, the entertainment was brilliant and i will definitely be recommending this restaurant!",,
"went for wedding anniversary last week, booked in advance. Fantastic meal and great atmosphere. Had small bottle of Champage given to celebrate.",,
great selection and tasty food. good service and fun entertainment. A little pricey but a good night out.,,
Diverse menu - italian and american cuisine mostly - and waitstaff that is attentive AND easy on the eyes :) Quite a fun place for food and drink and friends.,,
There is great entertainment at this restaurant with a cabaret at 9pm in the evening but the food is not that great. The burgers are way overseasoned and lack real flavour. The portion sizes are very American so be prepared to not finish everything on your plate. The service was very good.,,
"fabulous restaurant, food was excellent,italian and mexican, the atmosphere was great in here, the staff are extremely friendly and obviously enjoy working there, very busy but always have time to talk to you, always a queue waiting to be seated but well worth the wait, we found this place second to last night so ate here for both nights.",,
"Great place to eat if fun is on the agenda as well! Staff turn into singers, dancers etc whilst food is being served. Happy birthday sung to parties celebrating, special requests also.  Food is good and you do need to be hungry!!!! Several dishes are offered in smaller portions.  The only downside is you can't book unless 10 or more dining, queues can be rather long.",,
All I can say is make sure you are hungry to get the get the benifit from this place. They will ask if you have been there before because the portions are big and brilliant value and taste out of this world,,
Once again a fantastic meal. The ribs are out of this world. Steak always cooked to perfection and chicken nice and succulent. Will be going back again before the end of the holiday.,,
"Certainly not Cypriot cuisine but great fun. We went for a 9th birthday and thoroughly enjoyed the evening, service was excellent and food as good as any other themed restaurant I've visited. The children enjoyed the entertainment and face painting etc. Not a sophisticated place but fine for a family night.",,
"Food ok. Girl singers, costumed characters, always full, but not one for a return visit. families with small kids seemed to be having a good time.",,
"This is probably the busiest restaurant in Paphos and I'm not totally sure as to why. That's not to say the service is poor, because it most certainly isn't, the food is good though not great, and the prices are probably a little above par for the area.    There is entertainment, to a degree, which I guess sets it apart to an extent, but it isn't something you would be devastated to have missed!    I.had the ribs to start, which were ok, and a chicken dish which was nice as a main. Would it make me rush back? Well no. But would I say avoid it, certainly not.    All in all a hard place to review as it's not bad, but it certainly isn't a market leader. I guess to me it has a bit of a fast food joint about it which wasn't what I was looking fir in my evening meal. Truth is, one mans meat is another mans gravy!",,
we made a booking as there was 16 of us and everytime we drove past it was packed.  sevice was fab all food came out at the same time.  most of us went for the big portions to see what they was like.  steak was lovley pepercorne sauce a little hot but suppose wer just use to it been creamy back home. good value and we was there when show was on,,
"We had dinner here for the third time, I must say the food was delicious again. I recommended this restaurant to our friends and they all loved it too. I suggest you make a reservation as the queues can be long if you turn up after 6.30pm.",,
"We ate at Fat Mama's twice during our 2 weeks stay in Cyprus, the restaurant itself is clean, modern and always busy. The food was very good and the bogof offer on cocktails between 5-7 is a must. The service was ok but could be improved. A nice twist is the dancing girls at regular intervals.  The food portions are lets just say not small!!",,
I went in and reserved a table for 17 people earlier in the day and when we got there we had been split into 2 tables but it would have been easily sorted  Then we were told by 1 member of staff that we were eligible for bogof cocktails then another member of staff refused to serve us them  There were 5 families in our group and we were told that they would not take 5 seperate orders but they would give us a pen and paper and we could sort the bill out ourselves  The food was very nice but 2 of our families had finished there main course for 25 mins before the other main courses came and the apparent reason was we had ordered too many starters!!!  We have been going to fat mama s for the last 8 years but wont be back as the service was very poor,,
Booked this place duting our holidays in Paphos after reading many nice reviews. Unfortunately on arrival they lost our reservation and there was no available table. So we had to wait for at least 30 minutes for a table which was really frustrating especially when you are hungry. Food and portions were descent and service good.,,
noboy asked me why my plate was still full the chicken was not cooke they just took the plate away and then wanted sweet orders just not intrested.,,
"We visited Fat Mamas last year and decided to go again this year.Glad we did, it's absolutely brilliant. The food is fantastic and the portions are massive. The kids enjoyed the entertainment and everyone had a great night. Will definitely go again",,
"We've visited Fat Mama's several times over the last few years and always enjoyed the fun atmosphere and massive portion sizes, especially the ribs. This year was the first time that we have been to cyprus in May and we could definitely tell that the new staff were struggling and not ready for the start of the season. Our drink order took three attempts to get right, one waitress was quite rude, the bill was wrong and food not quite up to scratch. this place is normally quite good and i am sure over the next couple of months it will get better.",,
"If you go to PAPHOS then you have to go to Fat Mama's. It's fabulous, the food is delicious. I had the Lasagne which was huge but gorgeous. My husband had a steak which he said was cooked perfect. All the staff are happy and friendly. They even have a little stage show going on. Two young ladies sing and dance to old style 40s / 50s music. Just something a little different to while away a warm evening. Fabulous a must.",,
"We ate twice here recently. First time, the ribs, amazing! Very tasty and tender. Second time, we both had burgers and were blown away, they were tender, juicy and packed with flavour.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Don't fall for the cocktail offer which we did - buy 1 get 1 free - what you don't see is the 'only between 6-7' as this small print is at the base of the promotion leaflet and is concealed by the stand holding the leaflet in an upright position. Cocktails were lovely though!",,
This restaurant is always busy which speaks for itself. The food is great and you are not rushed. Reasonably priced and if you can manage the ribs then you're a better man than me. They are huge. The staff provide a cabaret as well which is very entertaining and a photo opportunity with Fat Mama and Big Willy is great fun.,,
"Really, really excellent food at reasonable prices. 14 euro for a fillet steak which was cooked to perfection. My son pestered me to go back again as he said his burger was the best he's ever had. We didn't as we only had a few days and I like to try different places. Good service also.",,
"We'd heard so much about this place that last year we had to try it. Unfortunately due to a teething baby and a sunburned 9 year old who got upset mid dinner we couldn't enjoy our food and had to leave early even though the staff were very, very helpful, offering to box up our meals for us take with us. So this year we decided to try again and we were so glad we did! The food was excellent, the staff very friendly and helpful and the kids well behaved!! We went early on as we had the kids with us which meant we could take advantage of a couple of drinks offers. The meal cost less than we thought it would and was delicious. Highly recommended to anyone.",,
"Back again at Fat Mamas - and as usual everything was perfect. I had King Prawns a la Vincenzo - think that's right - you have to trust the chef, and I am so glad I ordered these. They were the best ever with the most delicious sauce and coconut rice... superb! Recommend to everyone.",,
"We decided to eat here based on recommendations from other people. Upon arrival we were given a table straight away, there were 8 of us in total, the staff we friendly and helpful. we had been told that the portion sizes were large, therefore we all decided not to have a starter. Our food order ranges from steaks, chicken, ribs and burgers, when we placed our food order we were advised the food would be around 20 minutes, the food came within in time given and the portions were indeed large. All our meals were delicious and those who had steaks were cooked to the order requested, we were all stuffed. During dinner there is a cabaret where is the girls dance which gives entertainment while you eat. I would recommend Fat Mamas to anyone visiting Paphos.",,
"Recommend by friends so thought would try it out . As we approached there where three dancers doing a routine . looked at menu waited to be seated. English member staff very friendly and helpful, staff mixture of locals and English . menu extensive I opted for garlic bread with cheese starter, my friend went for the onion rings . for main my friend got lasagne,and I went for the hog burger; to say portions are large is an over statement lol we where stuffed,the dancers came out ever 15 min . to be honest I don't think they are needed,but kids love it . worth and visit",,
"Great night, great food, with a wee bit entertainment thrown in! Very good! Ribs were amazing as were the cocktails! Drinks were a bit pricey.",,
"Food is lovely. If you can see past the ridiculous embarrassment of the dancers coming out every 5 minutes whist your trying to have a nice meal, you'll have a lovely time 😋",,
"Visited Fat Mama's whilst on holiday during April 2015. Very friendly staff, great service and lovely food. Single portions are easily enough for 2 people.......excellent value",,
Great place to eat and drink. Very friendly staff and entertainment from the dancers.  Massive portions. Look for the lighter menu on some things or share.  I've never had a bigger lasagne.  Try them during happy hour for BOGOF cocktails.  One of the best places to eat in Paphos.  Make sure you try them out.,,
"Al & his staff yet again ! give you great food,great service,great entertainment & great prices,visited fat mamas twice during our stay last week, (one for my birthday)very well looked after and will always return when in paphos,thanks guys,Graham & Tina",,
"visited fat mamas when we was on our honeymoon april/may 2015, what amazing food, would recommend this place, you would'nt have to think twice about going back again, the size portions are massive, regular size is enough to feed 2 people then the fat mamas size is enough to share between 4 people, a family member who came with us to fat mamas ordered the Rack of ribs, which not was it just 1 rack it was about 4 whole racks, which could of been shared. Reasonable priced, food tasted so good. Was even given free champagne due to it being our honeymoon. Entertainment is very good with the girls dancing and doing the show. Staff were very friendly and chatty, would go back again when visiting paphos again.",,
"great food great staff great entertainment if you staying in Paphos Fat Mama's and Cowboy Willys restaurant is a must. Portions are huge, staff are amazing and entertainment is good.",,
had a great meal with lovely atmosphere in entertaining restaurant. They were very attentive to our babies in the group!,,
If you are hungry and enjoy good food cooked well then this is the place to eat. My tip would be to order the so called small portion option or the normal portion to share between 2.( we took more home in a dogie bag than we were able to eat).,,
This place was hen do magic! It was perfect fun and accommodating!    The staff were friendly helpful and lovely they made the experience excellent! we had a few food issues and they were respectful understanding and professional!    They also made it great fun by including the hen in a dance routine and they were very upbeat and enabled us to really have fun!    Perfect hen venue    The food was outstandingly good and surprisingly delicious and amazing value! It really was hard to believe what fantastic value you got with the food and cost. The portions were phenomenal and it was so tasty! Worth very penny and I would definitely go back !,,
"food amazing and entertainment even better, a must when in Paphos, the service is fantastic and menu so varied, portions are massive, kids and adults alike love it, attention to detail is 100%",,
"We visited Fat Mama's as it was recommended to us. We were not disappointed. In fact we visited twice!    Ribs are really tasty along with fillet steaks, hunters chicken, chilli,& cabanara.    I don;t think you can go wrong here you just need a good appetite.    The restaurant has a small floor show which also adds to the experience.",,
"This restaurant is great . Their is lots of choices including Mexican ,American, fresh pizzas, steaks etc. the staff are so friendly and do a fantastic job of making everyone welcome. They have shows on sometimes in the evenings. They have characters for the kids. You must visit this place it is fantastic.",,
"20 of us went to the restaurant and had a really good time. The menu covered a lot of options, including kids size menus. The food itself was very good but the portion sizes where hugh, even the starters were massive. I great place to pig out if you want too.    The staff were excellent and nothing seemed too much trouble. The entertainment was superb. We had dancers doing various routines and it really added to the feel of the evening.    A great place to go too, but wear loose fitting trousers or dresses, you will need too with the size of the food portions.    would recommend to all, couples, large parities and children alike.",,
"Had a lovely time there, the staff was very friendly, my son liked the show, and food, the ribs are to die for there was plenty, if your a big eater get large, if not just go for the regular, it's still big meal, they also done Budweiser a big treat for my husband, so good all round I think, entertainment was good too.",,
"Went here for evening meal. Greeting we got was so friendly and service was excellent. Fantastic choice of food and when it arrived ,after a very short wait , it was great. Halfway through the meal the music went up and three of the waitresses, dressed for the occasion, came out and danced ...good fun. Definitely recommend if your staying in Paphos.",,
"This ia a restaurant you will either love or hate! Myself the latter. It's is always busy and with long  queues to get in as you can't book a table here. The food in fairness is not bad at all, but everything seems to be very rushed as they just want to keep turning the tables over once the queues start. Portions are massive so beware as most could be shared. Entertainment is a bit tacky but at least they do something! Dare say the teenagers will have me back there again this year, so give it ago.",,
"Great Place. Really Good Welcome Smooth Efficient Service And Very Reasonably Priced.. The Food Is Just Superb, Hardrock Cafe And Planet Hollywood, Watch Out If Fat Mamas Ever Comes To The U.K. Huge Portions Of Food, The Ribs Are The Best I've Ever Had. Entertainment By The Staff As Well During The Evening. If You Like American Food, Don't Leave Paphos Without Visiting This Place. A Special Mention To Rio Who Went The Extra Mile To Make Sure That We Had A Good Time",,
it was a really good night just a bit pricy and the music was too loud I had to shout to talk but it's still a nice place,,
"If you enjoy your food like my husband and I then you will love this restaurant! The food tastes very fresh and the portions are huge....not for the faint hearted! If you like your meat, go for the small portions of ribs.... you will not be disappointed! The entertainment is brilliant also, dancers, and singers entertain you whilst you eat! A must try if you visit Paphos!!",,
"food and show the same time.good food and the waiters give a little singing dansing show.we ordered the half portion for pasta and spare ribs and it was large portion and tastefull.but in august is very busy and they dont make reservatios and they let you waiting on the bar ,not even they have free tables.but overall is worth it,i am local and i go there very often",,
A Great reataurant but very busy with big queues outside so they have a tendancy to rush you & your orders arrive to quickly together for you to enjoy your meal. but the staff put on a good show while you are there.,,
"We found this a bit pricey but having said that the food was a good quality and very large portions .The garlic bread was mor of a loaf ,well done",,
"The food was really nice and massive portions. It's a BBQ and Mexican restaurant, ribs and wings etc and fajitas and that kind of thing. It's a strange kind of place, they had entertainment, girls dancing and singing, it was fun but we weren't expecting it. Would go again.",,
"We had dinner there last night. Great food with generous portions, friendly staff and good entertainment from dancers. Highly recommend a visit and great value for money.",,
"Enormous portion sizes. Suggest you bear that in mind when ordering as you might struggle to fit into your Speedo's on the following day. Ribs good, otherwise found some of the other dishes a little ordinary.",,
Huge portions and a great hit with the kids - Fat Mamas is an essential part of a trip to Paphos. The ribs continue to be the benchmark against which all others - world over - are compared by our sons! Amateur cabaret makes for a bit of fun during the meal too!,,
"We visited this restaurant in april as a couple. Food was delicious, despite the fact, that we was waiting for food more than 30 minutes (by mistake in the kitchen , as we were told). Nice and friendly staff, even if they was little confused. Lovely entertainers.",,
Large portions(ribs to die for)professional dancers and singers.Happy friendly staff-all speak excellent.Went out of their way to make us feel at home,,
"So I hated going Paphos overall. However this restaurant really cheered me up. Me and two of my family members had drinks which were on offer two for one so we ended up with two each which was great! We had a big portion of cowboy ribs to share and they were the most amazing ribs I have ever tasted in my life! We also had desserts and it all worked out to about £30 which is amazing!    We were nicely seated as well, the staff are really funny and nice and they made sure we were not too hot and sat us down next to a fan on this very hot day. We went twice once during the day and once during the evening - in the evening there is great entertainment provided with great shows,music and dancing. Would definitely recommend!",,
"What a quality evening, the food was amazing and the portion sizes are out of this world and the prices aren't 2 bad either, really good service very attentive, it's well worth going for dinner later and watching the entertainment about 9 pm whilst eating dinner, would definately return",,
"We have been coming to paphos for the last 3 years and always make sure we come here. There is a lot of choice, something for everyone. We always enjoy our meals and love the entertainment. The waiting staff are always so friendly aswell. Compliments to the chef. See you in the summer.",,
"This restaurant is well worth a visit!    Meal portions are huge (ask for the half/small portion if you're not a big eater), staff are very very friendly & quite happy to meet any request you have - our daughter had the arrabiata pasta & it was too spicy (hot) for her, the waiter spied our daughter wasn't eating it & asked why, when we told him he simply whisked the plate away & brought her another meal of her choice - we didn't even have to ask - wonderful!    Drinks prices are reasonable - if you tell them it's your birthday/special occasion, you'll be bombarded with a group of girls singing around you & a free cocktail !!    Only open April - Oct/Nov. Would recommend & definitely return.",,
"When we went to Fat Mamas we expected a steak house but we werent expecting the awesome cabaret and atmosphere. the cocktails are yummy and a good price, the food comes in massive quantities but is of a really good quality also. really good value for money and a good night for families and couples alike",,
"Great America type Restaurant, 2 menus with loads of choices and full plates of food, great for Birthdays & Anniversary's, and the staff  Put on shows etc, ENJOY",,
"we really enjoyed the food and entertainment, even though my son was freeked out by fat mamma and dan! overall we had a great night. It is slightly more expensive than the other restaurants but well worth a visit as a treat.",,
They do half portions of lots of dishes as the original portion is gigantic! Good food and lots of choice. Really good entertainment is thrown in and all in all a must visit place for anyone on holiday in Paphos.,,
"Nice clean restaurant, average service and handy location. Food wasn't brilliant but wasn't terrible. Prices were about average. I wouldn't avoid the place in the future but I would try others first. There was cabaret entertainment the night we went but I don't know if that is the norm or if it was because it was the last night of the season.",,
"This is defo the place to go for an evening meal. The restaurant is clean and modern and the food is awesome! The staff are so good at what they do, friendly and very helpful. Live entertainment every night. During our holiday we ate there 3 times. If your there for a special occasion they make a fuss over you!! Considering how nice the food is the prices are pretty good!! Highly recommended!!",,
"If you want a traditional Greek night this is defiantly not the place to go. The food is very good although you are given far too much.The service is excellent but the entertainment is a little annoying . We visited in October and queued to get in, because of the busyness and noise of the place I don't think we will go again",,
"we have seen people queuing here every year ,so decided as we have gone at a quieter time and didn't have to queue we would go and see what all the fuss is about. After visiting I still don't know what all the fuss is about, it was just a glorified overpriced burger bar where girls get up and dance half way through. nothing special and will not be returning",,
"The shows used to be great, but quite poor now, a definite down turn. Food still good, but expensive wouldn't return for now.",,
"The food and the whole experience makes it a night to remember. The quality of the food is first class, the steaks are gorgeous, pizzas delicious.",,
"We have visited Fat Mamas a few times, the last being for a birthday meal. The entertainment was cheesy but really good fun, the food is excellent & they come and sing Happy Birthday to you (if you tell them it's your birthday of course!). A really great place to go for a special occasion.",,
"I went thinking I was gonna see a show of dancers in costumes with large headresses and plenty of sequins.  It was more like watching my children copy the music videos off MTV.  Costumes?? I bit of dirty frill on the bottom of skirt. This place has potential to really entertain its patrons, just a little investment in a few decent costumes and good dancers could see it being number 1.  Food was excellent and service was too.",,
We ate here on the final night of our holiday and wished we'd discovered it earlier. Lots of choice of food as well as a choice of portion size. Nice atmosphere and very attentive waiters. It was busy even though we ate early at 6.30 and got an early diner 10% discount. We ordered one pudding and 4 spoons for desert and could probably have shared dinners too as the portions are so huge. Will definitely return.,,
"I never miss visiting this place - Alex is the perfect host, the food is amazing and the staff and entertainment second to none. This is a must visit for anyone on holiday and worth queuing for, but I dropped by the night before and made a reservation.",,
Had a meal there tonight with my girlfriend and we both had a really nice meal with more than enough sized portions. Great service and brilliant atmosphere with a good choice of food on the menus. Will be looking forward to going back with an empty stomach next time. Family's and couples will love it.,,
"I visited this restaurant with my wife on our honeymoon. We were greeted by a friendly waiter and seated immediately. He was soon back to take our drinks order and we both ordered cocktails. These arrived promptly and we then placed our food order.    We chose the chilli beef nachos for starter; they arrived in no time and were absolutely delicious, however it could have easily fed four people.    For main course I chose a BBQ burger and my wife beef stroganoff. They arrived in decent time and again, the portions were absolutely huge. There was enough stroganoff for at least two people and the burger was also huge, with a large portion of fries with it. It was very nice, with the burger cooked excellently; my only gripe is that it came with mayo which wasn't mentioned on the menu.    We had a chocolate sundae for dessert which was also very nice.    Throughout the evening there was a group of girls dancing and singing, which was good enough fun.    All in all it was a pleasant visit with tasty food, however I would have liked to have been informed by the waiters of the amount of food we were ordering.",,
"Good food and big portions, small option is more than enough unless you have a huge appetite, entertainment is also good fun.  Book or go early as it gets busy later on",,
Massive portions but amazing value for money. Nachos are mammoth as are the ribs. Had a fab night. Staff were polite and friendly and atmosphere was great.,,
"Been coming to paphos for years, this was our first visit to fat mamas and was one of the best meals we've ever had here. Beautiful food, great portion sizes, good prices and what really stood out was the friendliness of the staff! (Something many places seem to be lacking these days). Really fun atmosphere too with some girl dancers etc. Was a great experience and we will definitely be back.",,
"Tried this place on our first night it was getting late 9:30ish and the place was packed out which was why we were enticed in. We saw waiters buzzing about with plates piled high with food and as we hadn't eaten since breakfast in the UK we licked our lips in anticipation. Ordered a large portion of ribs to share which were nice but as some of the posters' on here need to realise they are the same ones you can buy at most supermarkets in the UK. I had the 'cowboys portion' of fillet steak with hot sauce, fries and veg, the veg was discoloured the sauce was packet gravy with Tabasco in it. My wife had beef fajitas which was the same horrible veg of carrot & courgette batons sliced peppers and onions with chewy, sour chunks of sinewy beef. Add a couple of beers and 76€ is crazy money considering the lack of skill in the cooking and presentation.",,
Big plates of delicious food and dancing girls! Very enjoyable first visit. Ideally located for a short walk to bars and entertainment to work off your dinner,,
"really a good night out,good show lovely food, good large portion with friendly service at a very fair price. 5+stars",,
"Food, cocktail, staff and atmosphere were amazing well worth a visit. So good going back again. Portions are huge next time I'm gonna have one of the fab looking puddings. C",,
Went here with a group of friends after being highly recommended from one of their previous visits and was not disappointed! The food was fantastic and the portions are huge! I had the hot n spicy burger with added cheese and it was arguably one of the best burgers ive ever had! My husband had the large portion of ribs which was indeed LARGE! It came as 2.5 racks of ribs which were beautiful but he only managed yo eat half so be aware that the normal portions are mostly always enough to fill you! It was a very active and loud environment but as we were with 10 people this wasnt an issue as we were out to have fun :-) Would definitely recommend a visit here!,,
If your looking for a quiet nights dinner this is not where to go. Ever 10 or 15 mins there's a couple of girls that come out and sing a wee song in the centre of the restraurant. The portions are huge so get a small if it's available. Service is fab and the food is good too.,,
"My wife and I were taken to Fat Mama's by our friends who had been there before. We enjoyed it so much we returned a few nights later. The waiters and waitresses and welcoming and very friendly and enjoyed ""warning"" us about the very large portions. I mistakenly ignored the warning and had to plough through a very nice cannelloni served in a huge flan dish! The dancing girls with their regular routines add colourful variety and they are very entertaining, doing different routines on the two nights we ate there.  Quality of the food is excellent, service is excellent and the girls are fun. Great value for money all round.",,
"Delicious rack of ribs, salad & chips for an outstanding price. We had an early dinner at 5:30pm......two for one Leon beers plus 10% off bill because we were dining early...Wow. Ribs were spectacular....had to eat them with a fork as falling off the bone tender...full rack for 10 euro....could not eat them all, so waitress happily packaged them to go.",,
"I ate here with my partner on 4th October and we opted for the american menu... we had nachos to share then i had the ribs and she had burritos!! these were the best ribs i have ever had, the meat just fell off the bone and the meat was beautiful!! couldn't eat it all! you need a big appetite!! Defo be revisiting next year!!",,
"We were greeted by a charming waitress who was super all night. The food was fresh, well cooked and very large portions. The homemade burgers were superb. Three of the waitresses came out in different costumes to dance to a song and later in the evening there was a small cabaret. Will certainly go again.",,
Everything was spot on - the food - the atmosphere- the entertainment - 5 star ++++++ in my opinion The menu caters for every ones taste buds -,,
"Excellent Italian / American style restaurant serving steaks, Ribs etc. Word of warning though, Don't go large you'll never eat it all.",,
"We had heard about this place and thought it would be worth a visit for my birthday. To be honest I wish I had gone somewhere else. You def need to arrive early if you want to get a table and not wait. We arrived for 7.15 and got a table with out a problem, 30mins later there was a large queue of people waiting.  Menu is either Italian or American and portion control well there isnt any, if you come, I recommend not eating the whole of the day before you come.  The food itself is ok, we both had seabass which was adequate but expensive at 16 euros.  The main thing apart from the portion size that seems to sell the place are the staff who are either so over eager they are hyper or the girls who periodically come out in various costumes to mime to various tracks from Beyonce to Diana Ross which is odd when you are eating a meal. Give them their due, they do try had and I did feel sorry for them when the majority of people seemed more intent on eating their steak n chips rather than watching the performance. I can see why the place is popular you do get value for money but I thought it was more style over substance.",,
We were greeted by a totally charming waitress who during the whole evening couldn't do enough for us. The burgers are huge but homemade and top quality in fact there was not one item that we had that wouldn't get top marks. Some of the waitresses dress up and come out and dance every 20 minutes or so A great evening and a real gem if a find. Highly recommended,,
"If you love American / Italian style food, served in mega-portions, with entrainment included, then look no further!!    Whilst this restaurant would probably not appeal to everyone, it's a ""must-do"" for families on holiday. The menu is large enough to cater to all tastes and age groups and the entertainment is good fun - if you're celebrating a birthday or special occasion, then you really can't go wrong. There's photo-opportunities for the children with the larger than life characters, and dancing girls for the adults.    My only word of caution would be to ensure that you've not eaten all day - the portions are huge!!",,
"We hadn't been to fat mamas for a few years but decided to take a friend out on a Saturday night ,wow what fun we had there was a entertainment and the cheese burger was probably one of the best I have had in cyprus  Looking forward to going back",,
"Wow. Great fun, good food and good prices. Worth booking. They'll tell you that you can't but people obviously do. Great fun when your waiter/waitress starts singing and dancing. If you go to Paphos you should go here.",,
Excellent food and service Cant recommend this place enough The food is immense and the fillet steak is by far the best in Paphos Staff and management have this perfect,,
"If you're after a fun filled / belly filler of an evening then you need to go here!  All staff are friendly and look like they're enjoying every minute of it!  The food is great - too much choice on the menu!!!!!!!  Only given it a 4 because there's lots of cabaret type running around singing stuff that me and my boyfriend aren't fond of, but that's great for kids !  All in all a very nice experience and would definitely go back.",,
"If you have a bit appetite then this is the place to go.You should book becaues when you go you will see the que standing outside.The food is great and the portions are massive,enertainment is provided as well,great atmosphere.Great value for the money.",,
If your hungry go here !  The portions are massive  Good quality food but way to much  I had the ribs for main course only the small portion and it was too much I had the meat sweats by the end of the meal !  There's also a cheesy cabaret act while your eating that I wasn't keen on but I suppose it's all for good fun  Prices are good aswel  Would recommend,,
Eat here as part of a large group and the restaurant did a great job it looking after us with food and drinks arriving without delay.  We did order starters which was probably a mistake because the portions are so big we really struggled to finish our main courses and had to miss out on the desserts which looked amazing!  That said the food was well prepared and very tasty.  The restaurant also put on a bit of carbaret throughout the evening which is good fun and quire enjoyable.,,
"This place is always busy, which is a good sign, we have been coming here for years and the kids love the entertainment. The food is usually very good but can sometimes be a little below par. The portions are huge so make sure you share a starter and go hungry!  As a frequent visitor to Pafos it has become a tradition that we visit Fat Mama's, so it must be good as we keep going back.",,
"We ate here twice over the course of our holiday. The restaurant was always busy and there was a queue to get in on our second visit.    The food portions are massive. Nacho starter to share is a meal on its own and you could fill up just on that.    I had fajitas, bruchetta, pizza and nachos over the two visits and there was no complaint about the quality of the food.    Fat Mamas provide cabaret entertainment throughout the evening consisting of a handful of dancers which was nice to watch during the meal.    It's one of the pricier restaurants in the area but that's balanced by quality and quantity of food.    My only negative comment is that I had vegetarian fajitas which was shown as an option next to chicken fajitas. When the bill came I was charged the same price for chicken fajitas even though all I had was vegetables. This is the only thing preventing me from giving this review 5 stars.    Definitely worth a visit if you're in paphos",,
"....very tasty food and HUGE portions. Few other issues but have to say the food was great and had a good night at Fat Mama's. Not the cheapest place in the surroundings you can go, but you get what you pay for. Has live entertainment which while not the best calibre is a nice bonus. Only complaint is service, we were told by one waitress we good divide the bill by families, then the next, quite frankly, rather abruptly, told us we couldn't. Two people's meals on our table arrived ~15 mins before the rest, and drinks and the bill took a while. Worth a visit when in Cyprus for some tex-mex/american or italian-esque fare.",,
"We visited here twice when we visited Cyprus, food was great big portions I had the chicken fajitas and the burger both times were great my 1 year old daughter loved the characters that came out while you were eating and I think she entertained most of the people eating here too lol! Staff very friendly was so glad we found this place!",,
Very yummy and large portions. Great value for money and lovely service. Would definitely visit again,,
"My husband & I went in August 2014 & I can say it was absolutely fantastic, the food was absolutely gorgeous, but I was so full I couldn't eat it all but it was absolutely the tastiest meal I'd had in a long time! Defo worth going too! 5 stars all round xx",,
"We had dinner here on Sunday night, the restaurant was busy but we was seated very quickly. We ordered garlic & cheese bread & chicken wings for 4 to share which were very nice. The rest of our friends ordered steak but I got hunters chicken & believe me the portions are big! No-one spoke until it had all gone, just proves it was good. We were stuffed but had to try a dessert & went for the white chocolate & raspberry trifle......yummy, couldn't eat breakfast the following day as I was still full.  Our waitress was very friendly & helpful even going to the kitchen with a few questions about my fellas dairy intolerance.  Returning to cyprus in April & will defiantly return.",,
"we when to fat mamas because there always seem to have a que of people outside so waiting for a table so we thought it must be extremely good place to eat. we when one night in august ,and did not have to wait for a table but it was extremely busy. service was a little slow but that was almost to be expected due to being packed.  none of us wanted starters just a main course was promptly told if we did not have a started our main meal would take about 40 mins and again would we like a starter. we did not want starter so we had quite along wait to eat . I also had a cocktail but it did not taste right , it tasted like the cream had started to go off.  I must say that I can not see what all the fuss . food was average and service slow and when we got the bill it had 2 drinks on it which we had not had (€11) . this was promptly removed when I complained, but if we had not checked the bill (something I always do)  singers and dancers are cheesy .  it would not be a place I would rush back to unless it was less busy.",,
"We are staying near here and it's busy every night, they had girls dancing for the entertainment show last night. We had bruschetta to share to start which was a big portion two large pieces each. Main course for my husband was veggie fahittas and I had the small portion of BBQ ribs, which I may say both portions were large. It's like all the restaurants are trying to compete by offering the biggest portions.. Which can be wasted if over faced.    Bottle beer was slightly expensive compared to other restaurants.    If we are completely honest my only real negative point and I do hope the management review this as we did complete the restaurant service questionnaire which was given to us by our waitress.  The bill showed the veggie fahittas to be charged the same price for meat ones, which is a bit cheeky allowing it was the veggie option and on checking the menu it's the only thing not priced.    So all you veggies please check this before you order/pay as this shouldn't be same as chicken/meat option. I would be interested for the management to explain the logic on this price.    That said the food was good so no complaints just a little niggle with prices.    Worth a visit.",,
"Stopped here in August for an evening meal. The food was either an Italian or American theme. The young staff were keen, helpful and gave honest advise. I had a burger from the American menu and my wife a pasta dish from the Italian. Both were excellent (burger was huge), and the price very reasonable. We were there early which entitled us to a ten percent discount so we simply gave them a big tip. Three girls did a very enthusiastic routine to celibrate people's birthdays and that alone was worth the tip ! Recommend .",,
"We have always wanted to try Fat Mamas and finally got round to it this year.  We went just before 7pm and didn't have to wait for a table (it did get busy later)  There is a good variety on the menu and u can pay extra for a mama size portion. I was expecting some outrageous portion for the mama size but to be honest it wasn't a huge portion, I would say it was the right amount however we didn't order starters so really just depends.  We enjoyed the singing and dancing although it is a bit cheesy, defo try it out, worth a visit :-)",,
"Brilliant food and great entertainment.  Unless you're a massive eater, go for the normal portions otherwise you'll just waste it!",,
"We had always meant to try Fat Mamas over the last 7 years but never got around to it, last night we did and it was worth the wait! If only we had done it sooner!  We knew it's reputation and the fact that it's chocker every night tells it's own story.  The food and service were equally brilliant, the entertainment (unexpected) then topped off the overall experience.  The portions are huge, I had a small ribs which may have been enough for two, the nachos starter was more than enough for both of us.  The ribs were perfection, just falling off the bone, my partner had chicken fajitas which came sizzling on the plate with an impressive array of sides.  We really could not fault anything, maybe if they didn't do such big portions we may have had room for dessert!!  Would highly recommend for couples and families alike, it was brilliant and we will be returning at some point.",,
"Wow! What can I say except don't eat breakfast or lunch if you are planning on eating a full meal here! I had visited paphos many times before and have heard so many recommendations for this place, but never visited, however seen as we were staying over the road this year we thought it would be rude not to try!  Not knowing what to expect myself and my partner ordered a rack of ribs to share for starters (which were massive and came with chips!!) followed by a burger with everything on for my partner and lasagne for myself...... I think I managed a quarter of my lasagne and NONE of the chips which again came with it! We had three drinks and the bill came to €39 can't complain at that!  We decided that seen as were were so outfaced on our first visit we needed to try it again another night this time with no starters and not much to eat through the day, much more enjoyable... Infact we went back a third time.... Fat mamas we very nearly were by the end of our holiday!!!",,
We had to wait a little while for a table but it was about 8pm so we wasn't too bothered. There was live entertainment and the atmosphere was great. It invites you in as the restaurant is outside too. The food was delicious and would definitely return! Great food at great value!,,
"I can't say anymore than Excellent food and service, entertainment was excellent, if your i9n the area its a must visit.",,
"This place was Heaving every night off our holiday but we were left disappointed, the Waiters didn't really care they had very little personal skills and couldn't answer any query without getting there management. My partner had a Steak which we expected to be a good size and it Came tiny and Dry although very expensive.",,
I was there with my wife.we had 3 deferent starters to share and for main we had rustigana and pizza.rustigana it was perdect.pizza was nice but not the best i had.,,
"We visited here as we heard it was the place to go if you were looking for a good night and were alittle disappointed.    The food was OK, big portions and you wont leave feeling hungry. Only problem was the starters, the starters are all meant for 4 people so if it is just you and a partner, you have to order 1 of the same starter between you?? We shared the ribs starter which was OK, not the best ribs I have ever had. Looked and tasted like they have been boiled in a weak BBQ sauce for a few hours and were too fatty, I thought good ribs were meant to be slow cooked, then BBQ'd and basted in a BBQ sauce??    The main courses were good, my wife had the fakitas which were nice and I had one the steaks - steak was cooked and seasoned well.    Furthermore, the cocktails tasted weak, seriously lacking in alcohol, my guess is that they only contained 1 shot of watered down alcohol. At 6 Euros each they are not expensive but were not worth the money. I also ordered a double vodka and lemonade which did not tatse like a double shot, I was re-assured there was about it certianly didnt taste like it.    The service was fantastic, even though ti was really busy, this could not be faulted. It didnt feel like we were rushed all evening.    Would I return, unfortunately not as there is alot better places to eat in Paphos.",,
"A family member recommended visiting this restaurant for a birthday celebration.    It's a feel good atmosphere, great fun for all. Ideal place for kids entertainment. Entertainers dress up, sing and dance. They make a special effort for birthdays, sing you a happy birthday and present you with a sparkly cocktail or cake.    Food is delicious, portions are quite big. Plenty of choice on the menu. Service was excellent and was definitely good value for money. Will be planning to return and would recommend to anyone.",,
"Have been visiting Fat Mamas for years and as the majority of reviews state if you want huge portions, great atmosphere, birthday/celebration acknowledgement in the form of a dance routine by the girls and a 'Happy Birthday' song and a drink, good entertainment, great service and competitive prices you are in the right place.  It's also the only restaurant we've seen that has had queues even through the economic crisis!  Some don't like to queue so go early (discount before 7) or book.  Recommend the ribs!",,
"Beautiful food , steak cooked just as we likes it , friendly staff also little entertainment if you go around 7",,
"get in before 7pm for a 10% discount, also buy one get one free on cocktails.Face painting and nails etc. good value. Children's meals are good.  Evening show starts around 9.30pm for about 20 minutes really good end to the night.  Recommend the hot spicy pizza.",,
"Heard all about fat mamas and was busy whenever we went past. We ordered garlic bread with cheese. No cheese on it, my seafood pasta with tagliatelle came with linguine and was bland. Prawns chewy. My partners chicken was pink inside. Great evening if you want the next day of your holiday ruined.",,
"There is nothing more to say about this restaurant that hasn't already been said :) Fat Mama's were able to accommodate a large croud of 19 at short notice (4hours) but kept us updated via email which was very helpful! The portion sizes are MASSIVE, we all decided starters would be a good idea to begin with, how wrong were we! Even the starters were the size of meals, the majority had to take their mains home and eat them the next day :) The entertainment was good and the service was pleasant! Overall, a great place to eat if you are hungry, and good value for money :D",,
"The food here is great! A good variety of food so everyone has something they like! The staff are great and the entertainment is good for the family, especially the young ones! Amazing portion sizes and good value for money! Would definitely recommend.",,
Sorry some people just arnt happy .we on the other hand was brilliant food brilliant night will deffo go bk x,,
"We often go to Fat Mamas. The food is good if you like Pizza,steaks,ribs etc. If you come here for a traditional Cypriot meal you will be disappointed. This is about big portions and fun.    The Pizzas are superb as is the steak.    The entertainment is fun but is just that a bit of fun, don't expect anything earth shattering.    The staff can be hit n miss, some are pleasant and helpful some of the others pre occupied and can appear rude.    Always busy the restaurants next door must wish for half there custom!    Go and enjoy    Overall, great meals, fun night out.",,
"Great food at ok prices, perhaps a little expensive but you get what you pay for. Everything was fresh and tastes great. The staff were incredibly nice, the atmosphere was fantastic. We decided to make this place our last meal before heading home as we'd been previously and loved it. Check it out for yourself and you won't be disappointed.",,
"although the food is great,(something for everyone) its the staff that make us return! They dance, joke, and really enjoy being there which makes u enjoy being there!",,
"Fat mamas is an all round great place! The atmosphere is great, everyone is happy and smiling aspecially the waiters/waiteresses! We have been 4 years to Cyprus, paphos, and always make a visit to the restaurant at least twice. We went there a few days ago and really enjoyed our meal, but you must be hungry! Perfect if you've had a busy day and only a bite to eat! We love this family restaurant, and love visiting. The majority of the waiters/ waiteresses are the same each year which makes it even more memorable! This place is a must!! ""Complements to the chef"" and a big shout out to Andy, Andreas and Maria who made our night",,
"I went with some friends to Fat Mama's last night. We have heard so much about this restaurant over the years so we decided to give it a try last night.  It was not too busy didnt have to wait more than 5 minutes to get a table.  The waiters were very busy and didn't have time to tell us about the menus. The waiter that took our drink order hardly looked at us, he was looking all around him, didn't listen to out orders and he was shouting to the other waiters while we were talking to him.  The girl that took the food orders was nice and polite  It didn't take long for the food to come. I had ordered veal marsala, a dish I have had before at other restaurants and I know how it should taste. My friends had steak and another veal dish.  The vegetables were fresh and perfectly cooked BUT here it comes. All the food was totally tasteless. The vegetables, the meat, the sauce etc tasted of absolutely nothing!!!! The veg, the meat and the sauce were cooked without any salt, pepper och spices. The sauce on the veal marsala was like a beige jelly like sauce, completely tasteless. I am not a fan of salt but I had to put so much on to get any taste of out the food at all. We all said exactly the same thing. It was so bland that it was like eating cardboard. We were very hungry and the waiters were busy so we ate the food anyhow. We did tell the waiter when she came to clear the table. She told us that it was too late to complain, fair enough. But then she carried on and on about how they can not cook with even salt and pepper as there are some people that can't eat salt and spicy food. She said thats why they have salt and pepper on the table so you can add flavor yourself!! I have never in my life had such completely tasteless food served to me in a restaurant before. The entertainment was very unprofessional, 3 or 4 young waiters dressed up in wigs etc running around for 2 minutes to music 3 or 4 times during the time we were there. All in all the experience was very disappointing. We will not go back.",,
"We visited a couple of weeks ago (in August) and and went at 6.30 which had the bonus of half price cocktails and 10% off the bill and we were able to book as it is too early for the main entertainment. At 7 pm this all changes (no booking, no half price cocktails etc). However, there were lots of birthdays in early too so we seemed to have the dancing girls coming out every 5 minutes to do a dance and then wish somebody a happy birthday. The children liked meeting and getting their photo with Fat Mama and whoever the other character is (sorry can't remember).    I loved my food. I had sea bass with a ginger sauce and I ordered it as it sounded a bit different to anything I had tried before and it really was delicious. My husband had rattlesnake steak which he enjoyed but didn't exactly rave about.    My youngest fell asleep as soon as we arrived and when she woke up was adamant that she was only going to have plain spaghetti, something on every menu in paphos except Fat Mama's, but they were happy to do this for her and brought it quickly.    I am glad we went as it had been recommended to us and it was something a bit different. If we go back in 4 or 5 years time when we can stay out a bit later and see the cabaret I'd go again.",,
"We were on holiday as part of a large party and visited Fat Mama's many times as the food was always good quality and excellent value for money. The staff were very accommodating, particularly Andy, and the food arrived quickly and all together. The portions are very large so we would recommend a small portion unless you have a big appetite!",,
"I really would like to give Fat Mama's a huge round of applause for being incredibly cheesy whilst also being an incredible restaurant. I can't really count the number of time two dancers came out to dance to a well known song followed by a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' to one of the customers in the space of a couple of hours, but it was great fun and a highlight of our holiday.    The food was American/Italian and it was great, if I'm being honest, it was one of the best steaks I've ever tasted. The staff were extremely helpful and the service was speedy and we weren't rushed which was an extra bonus.    There's also the 'Compliments to the Chef' trick - once you've finished your meal, if you say 'compliments to the chef' to your waiter, when they are taking all the empty plates away they shout in the kitchen at the top of their voices 'COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF FROM TABLE XX' to which the kitchen replies 'YES CHEF!' which we found highly entertaining and of great comedy value.    Ignore all the negative reviews on here, you don't go to Fat Mama's if you want a serious night out. It's great fun, with great family entertainment. 5 stars, thank you very much.",,
"Excellent, a must visit for any holiday maker. The supersize portions are a must try!! The girls dancing adds to the experience and a great few hours for all.",,
We have been to this restaurant on two other visits to Cyprus but found this time that it was no where as good. The food was mediocre and the service was terrible. I asked for a vodka and coke but just got a coke. When I mentioned this to the waitress she didn't seem to be interested. They had some awful woman pretending she could sing and to be honest she was appalling! The dancers weren't much better. It's also not good value for money and no where near as Gustoso.    We will not be returning on this or any other visit to Pafos!,,
"Came back to Fat Mama's cause we'd been a couple of years ago. Taken to a table ny a guy in a white t-shirt (compared to the others in black). We needed a minute to decide on drinks and he said he'd come back. However, almost 10 minutes later no-ome had even made eye contact. Once our server did come to the table service was as quick as it could be given how busy it was. Food quality was good but nothing spectacular any more. Bill came with no apology for the wait at the beginning and the guy who sat us couldn't wait for us to leave before he'd grabbed our glasses to clear the table. Very disappointing :(",,
"food - very good, and lots of it  music - lots of it, very loud, mostly modern pop  cabaret/entertainment - 3 dancers who also treated those whose birthday it was to a song and a funny hat...  not the place to go if you want a quiet night out, but go once just for the experience (and the food)  staff are friendly  the prices are about average",,
Excellent value for money and great food. Entertainment very good and unusual. Well worth the half hour wait,,
"Food was good and plentiful but the attitude of the waiters left a lot to be desired. Should rename this place from Fat Mamas to Bad Manners! Unfriendly, abrupt and unapologetic.  Taking away drinks that we hadn't finished. Almost knocking one of our guests from his chair without any signs of an apology, plus a few other small incidents. By the way, they won't let you split the bill if your in a party which means someone has to sit there and work it all out if your all chipping in.  Expecting a smarmy response, if they read this, because that seemed to be the overall attitude. That and they didn't really want you there.",,
"The food here was less traditional but still delicious, we visited a few times and always received a warm welcome. The portions were huge would recommend ordering small portions. My daughter ordered a children's rack of ribs and got a rack and half of ribs. It does get very busy on a Saturday night but you can book in advance",,
Visited Fat Mama's whilst staying in Coral Bay. Food was delicious and arrived in reasonable time considering how busy it was. Entertainment is a bit cheesy but atmosphere was nice. Service was good.,,
"Vibrant, busy restaurant. Don't be put off by the queue. It moves quickly. And you can wait in the bar and order your cocktails! Great speedy service. Those waiters work hard. Extensive menu. Do not choose the large portion size - you won't even be able to manage the 'small' portion. Entertainment dubious but harmless. Going back next year for the ribs!",,
"This was a great place to eat ,buzzing atmosphere,entertainment and huge portions,it was more pricey than other places but worth it.",,
"My wife & I have just got back from Pathos (our 7th time there) & every time we go we head for Fat Mamas & Cowboy Willy's Rib Shack because we know we will have a really good time with great food.    Yes the portions can be on the large side but overall the food is expertly cooked whether it be Italian, burghers or ribs. The ribs are to die for & having seen the mains portion I can't imagine what animal it's from, they are massive & I learnt the first time that the starter ribs are more than adequate. The meat just falls away & is gorgeous.    This year we noticed that instead of every half hour or so when the waitresses come out & sing pop songs they were coming out in different costumes about every 15 minutes or so. This made it feel more of an entertainment place to eat rather than a restaurant with occasional entertainment. Fat Mama & cowboy Willy appear out front to pose for photos with the children (& adults if the mood takes you) which just adds a little bit more fun to the whole experience.    If you go to Pathos for a holiday, you really must give Fat Mamas a try, you wont be disappointed & if you are like us it will become a regular place to go when in Pathos.",,
"i love fat mama's. I've been Cyprus twice and I've been fat mama's 5 times in the two times I've been Cyprus ! its a fun restaurant, entertaining and fun. and the food is lovely. the sizes of the meals are massive but the food is lovely and i would suggest only getting a small portion on most of the meals ! but the food is beautiful not bad price and lovely staff!",,
The portions here are bloody brilliant everyone is english and they have entertainment on every night. Every person I met had been to fat mama's.,,
"Tacky. Cheap. Trapped in time. Marvellous!    Fat Mama's is a classic burger, wings, ribs, lasagne, pizza, chips, nachos, garlic bread sort of place where the emphasis is on daftness, good times and ridiculously gigantic portions. (If you are low carbing or want to eat some green vegetables you might want to skip the rest of this review.)    But here's the thing - the food is surprisingly good. And I mean really good.    Fat Mama's has taken a formula and stuck with it. It works really well - like a well oiled machine and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if this is the most profitable restaurant in the whole of Paphos.    So if you have kids under the age of 18 this is the place to take them, relax and let the staff do the entertaining. You should definitely book in advance if you don't want to queue and come 8.30 pm there are always queues.    Top tip - book before 7pm. Get your order in and get free cocktails and 10% off your bill.    It's all good.",,
Had some super meals here during our two week stay. Food plentiful and delicious.  Andy the waiter was brilliant nothing too much trouble. Dancers were great too.  Would have loved a t shirt but they didn't have any left.,,
"Had a short wait at the bar where we were served quickly. Friendly staff who kept beer and food coming. I was sceptical about the singing which came every 20 mins, actually good sound and good moves really enjoyed it. My kids loved it and it made our night.  The portions are huge if anything to large but of a high standard. Good value for money.",,
"Despite always being busy, this place runs like a well oiled machine. The staff are friendly, helpful and very hard working and nothing is too much trouble. The food is excellent, especially the ribs, steak and fajitas. Massive portions too although you can opt for smaller ones if you wish. The entertainment is lighthearted and fun and appeals to both adults and children. All in all, an excellent place to eat and definitely worth a visit. Just don't leave it till the last day or you won't be able to go back!",,
"Get early or be prepared to queue, although staff very efficient. Food excellent and staff friendly and helpful. When the menu says large portion it means LARGE, if you have to think about it, take the smaller option. You can tell it's quality - always full and no touts outside trying to entice you in. No negatives at all.",,
"Our family HAS to go there when we visit Paphos! We love the food, the atmosphere and the entertainment. Large portions, very tasty food, something for everyone. Be sure to get there early at peak times as there will be a queue to get in.",,
"Fat mamas is a popular place for dining in Paphos. We enjoyed a couple of family meals there- but be warned, the portions sizes are huge so don't be tempted to over order. Fortunately they do 'Small' portions which most regular people would consider to be normal/large size. Their Tex-Mex menu is recommended -enchiladas fajitas and chilli are all really good. The dancing entertainment is good fun, a little cheesy but it what makes the restaurant a bit different to many others.",,
"We have eaten here in the past and birth my children were desperate to eat here again. We arrived early- always queues as so popular. The food was ok, however the service was shocking. We waited 40 mins for our main course to arrive and then we were sat for 20 more mins after we finished eating with dirty plates in front of us. We weren't offered dessert or coffees. Left a bit disappointed.",,
Tried this restaurant as it had good reviews and was always busy. It certainly was busy when we got there. The food was good. Although as people have said in the past the cowboy portions are huge my boyfriend and dad had the enchiladas cowboy portion and the both said it was more like a standard portion. Overall a good experience but the staff were run ragged.,,
We have visited Fat Mama's several times over the last few years and it is always a fun evening! Very busy and lively with dancers coming out every 5/10 minutes to keep you entertained!  The burgers are absolutely lovely and the portions are massive so I wouldn't go for starters unless you can eat masses!  You will definately have a fun night here!,,
"great food and entertainment, easy accessable, on Tomb of the kings road not far from the kefaloniits hotel apartments",,
The food was so amazing. Not Greek food more like frankie and bennies. But cheaper and tastier. Portions were hugeeeeeeeeeeeeee and tasty. We had ribs but wish we shared them as they were massive. Great place,,
"Went here for a lively birthday celebration and that is what we got!! The place is noisy with impromptu singing, dancing and general fun. The portions are massive - we have one starter platter between 7 of us!!! The 'small' ribs looked like more than a full rack working on UK portions! if you seat before 7pm you get 10% off what are already decent prices. Well worth a trip.",,
"This place must be one of the best places in Cyprus, Paphos unlike the last castle while your waiting for your food they have little shows they put on to entertain you mainly singing also they get someone dressed up in a fat mamas suit and a cowboy wills suit(owned by the same people) and you can get photos with them although you might have to stay in a Line for a while it is definitely worth the wait so if you go to Cyprus definitely check it out",,
"We went for dinner on a Friday night and had a cracking time. We had to wait about 20 mins for a table but it's well worth it. Great service, good value for money, entertainment and really good food. Struggled to finish my plate of food but it was so good. I had the Chicken breast with blue cheese and broccoli. Well worth a visit if your in Cyprus.",,
"Not a bad meal but a bit pricey, plenty to eat we had spare ribs 40 euro for 2 of that about 20 euro went to the local pussy cats you do get a large portion and they will provide a box to take the leftover home.",,
"I live in Cyprus but haven't eaten at this restaurant in years, However was as good as I remembered it - attentive staff, excellent food, very good value - I will be eating there again on a regular basis!",,
"I visited Fat Mama's restaurant with friends. The atmosphere wes good with a great show by the staff. The food was ok, but it could be better. If you are really hungry this is the best place to go as the portions are huge.",,
"We waited for 15 mins at the front of the queue to be seated or even spoken to whilst there was at least 15 empty tables that we could of been seated at instantly..  I walked in and asked someone if there was a reason why we had not been seated. The reply I got by a waiter who was walking around doing nothing was.. "" everyone has there set jobs to do someone will be over""  When we were finally seated we tried choosing our food asked the waitress for her advice and she didn't have a clue!!  As previous traveller said don't bother!!  We had ribs which were the worst ribs we had and chicken fajitas which were ok at the least.  When the entertainment came out we thought great this will be fun, but they sang for about 1 min and disappeared.. That carried on whilst we were there. ""Laughable""",,
We visited Fat Mamas for my hen party and it was brilliant! Huge portions and so much choice!! My cousin had told them it was my hen (I'm sure they must have known looking at us all dressed up!) and they got us up as part of the act doing the YMCA with the girls!! Gave me a bottle if champers for being a good sport too! Yummy cocktails. A fab night which I shall always remember. We are coming back to Paphos for our 1st anniversary and my hubby wants to see what it's all about so we shall be back xx,,
This was actually my second visit to fat mamas. Nothing had changed! Atmosphere was amazing as was the food! Great fun for all the family!,,
"We went here shortly before heading off to the airport as it was just metres from our apartments. After a week of eating delicious, fresh, delicious Cypriot food we were so disappointed to be presented with what we ate here. We had been to Laona the night before which made this experience even worse as we'd had our best meal ever in Cyprus there. Massive portions of tasteless, greasy junk food; sauce in plastic pots; even the cokes we ordered tasted watered down. Meanwhile, there were wasps everywhere, some weird 'entertainment' and kids on arcade machines. I think it's the sort of place you go on holiday if you don't like 'foreign' food or if your kids can only behave if they're being constantly stimulated by games, toys and colouring crayons.    The staff were ok but you don't get the same server throughout so they don't know where you're at; at one point our plates had barely touched the table and we were asked if we wanted to give our compliments to the chef!    By the time we left they were queuing at the entrance to get in whilst some of the great tavernas either side remained empty. Why you would want to travel thousands of miles to eat this slop I have no idea. Some reviews warn: 'Stay away if you don't like big portions'; I would say: 'Stay away if you like decent food.'",,
"We ate here on our last night as it was right by our hotel and it always looked packed when we walked past. On this occasion I wish that once again we had walked on by.    The food was bland and mass produced and the coke was watered down to the point where it was hardly coloured. The ribs had been boiled to within a inch of their life and were swimming in a weird sweet sauce and whilst the fajitas were almost passable they nowhere near justified their 17 euro price tag.    This is also the first restaurant where a waiter has come to us before we have tasted a bite to say ""foods good yes, I'll pass on your compliments to the chef"" I'm not sure if he was joking....    I can't understand why anyone would eat here where there are great, local restaurants literally next door which don't serve mass produced bland stodge. I can see its appeal to families who just want chips and burgers but if you don't avoid at all costs.",,
Excellent everything you need for a family restaurant entertainment excellent staff and delicious food,,
Atmosphere was electric from the moment you enter. Great food choice Food was delicious Great entertainment throughout the evening Will definately be going back,,
A fun night. Great Food. Friendly staff. EVERYBODY seemed to have a birthday! ( A free drink!) They didnt seem to have an area for smoking. The lady on the next table kindly shared her cigarette with me while I ate!,,
This is where England likes to eat. You have to spare a thought for the Cypriot neighbours looking across from their empty premises at Fat Mama's bursting with people at 7pm.  They do what they do very well. Good Ribs (I do prefer the membrane to be removed from my ribs but otherwise very good). Burger was good although why I had to order an adults one for my 6 year old is a mystery to me (no burger on kids menu)  Unless you are a trucker don't bother with the large portion of ribs (2 and a half racks of baby backs!)  Overall very pleased. Kids enjoyed the place.,,
"This restaurant is such fun and the portions are huge! The staff are attentive, there is intermittent singing and generally good fun providing a great atmosphere. We got seated at 6.45 and by 7.00 there was a constant queue outside. The food is big, full of flavour and there is a good choice for everyone on the menu. The cocktails are good too. Unfortunately I have yet to sample the desserts as I have never had any room for them. We always come here when visiting Paphos and will continue to do so.",,
"Love the pizzas. Salads are delicious. Service is always prompt. The entertainment by the waiting staff is fun. Overall, good food and an enjoyable evening.",,
"Vibrant and very busy, the food was very nice but if the beer was colder it would have been excellent. You can not drink a hot beer on a hot night it is like drinking something else....the service was ok, we asked the waiter to put the beer in the freezer for a bit which she did but had forgotten to bring it to us . When we did remind her, the beer she brought was still warm... Prices are reasonable and portion are larger so if you are not very hungry it is better to share.",,
"Nice menu choice, good service and food quality (we actually had a diner who didnt eat their meal becausee they just didnt like it - the restuarant automatically removed from the bill - we didnt ask..) Wine choice like everywhere in Cyprus is limited but they are willing for you to taste and choose which is nice. Cocktails are lovely and east to get a taxi in and out.. They will allow you to pay in English and the rates are VERY competitive but you have to spend over £150..",,
"You must go to this restaurant if you are in the paphos area. Nice friendly staff, good entertainment and excellent value for money! The food is also delicious!!",,
"How this place is not number one I don't know!!! The food was absolutely amazing!!!! We read about it on here and decide to visit! On the way the taxi guy said it was really nice. We were on an all inclusive holiday and wanted a break from it. For starter me and my partner had the sharing meat platter. Included nachos, chicken wings, ribs, potato skins. The ribs just fell off the bone. There were amazing. The platter was huge so please bare this in mind. For main my partner had the small ribs and fries and I had the BBQ burger with fries. The ribs wasn't a small portion I would have called it large but still amazing as the starter. The burger was out of this world marinated in a BBQ sauce. If you can't eat all your food you can take away which we did as we were so full. The staff and dancers as entertainment were really good. Waiter was very friendly. I defiantly want to return here before we go home. The bill was very reasonably priced to which was another plus.",,
"Very busy and vibrant place. We'd heard good reports on this place and came here for both our first and final nights.    Two menu's are provided, one is Italian, the other American style. The portions were enormous and all the food was very tasty from both menus. Really can't fault the place although service was a tad slow on the very busy final night that we came. Every now and then, proceedings are broken up with dancing and singing and the place is a fun place to be.    Just wished I'd tried the steak option here instead of the Farm House Tavern just down the road! Anyway, we both liked it and will certainly visit again when visiting Paphos in future. Some of the staff are nuts, but they're great fun and there's a real atmosphere in here.",,
Been coming to Paphos for a few years now and always visit Fat Mama's! By far best restaurant ever! Defo don't go if your not hungry or want a quiet night coz small portions and quiet nights just aren't their thing! See you next year!!,,
"Having been before I was looking forward to returning with my wife    Nothing has changed... Same decor, food, menu, theme, everything.... Just not carried off so well    Still worth a visit as a one off venue and theme... I just hope they can refresh it",,
"Fancied a night away from the hotel, as 2 weeks all inc can be a bit the same, even though the food was amazing!    Heard about Fat Mama's before going and kept going past so thought we would give it a go.    Food was nice, however the wrong order did come out, partner had ordered the large ribs, and what he got was the standard portion, which after he was half way through the original waiter noticed and came, and did come over it say it looked wrong and did he want more, which was observant!  I had a half portion of pasta and couldn't eat that, sizes too big which can be off putting!  Didn't queue for long to get it, as they turned the tables quick  Husband enjoyed the dancing girls ( a lot lol )  Glad to say we went however prefer to try the local Cypriot restaurants for the mezes and traditional food.",,
"Nice food and friendly staff. I struggled to eat all of my meal, as it was so big. Make sure you are hungry before you go!;)",,
Had high hopes as the taxi drivers etc all said how good it was here. Don't get me wrong it isn't bad but it is just you average tex mex type place with 5 girls trying their very best to entertain by doing some dances and singing in a small area.  But it is average but hey try it for yourseleves and prove me wrong!!,,
"Best restaurants as my in paphos! Get the ribs!!! Only spoiler was mid meal ""entertainment"" which was a bit mood spoiling. Aside from that a brilliant choice of Italian and western American grub!",,
"The food is perfect! The portions are huge, the entertainment is great and the service was amazing. We went here for my birthday while spending a week in Paphos and having previously been here when i was younger it was exactly if not better than I remember. I ordered fillet steak with pepper corn sauce, medium rare. I could not bring myself to leave it no matter how full I was!  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Cyprus as I did while I was out there.",,
Lovely resturant with good quality food and a lot of it. If your not hungry DO NOT go large!! Also a Perter Andre lookalike waiter.... made me smile!,,
"My boyfriend and I ate here on 3 occasions during our holiday. Food is always good and portions are huge so u will never leave hungry.  It is always very busy and most nights people are queuing to get in; always a good sign in my opinion.  The staff are always very friendly and work hard in such a busy restaurant.  Fat mamas is a lively restaurant with entertainment/cabaret show every evening.  There is also face painting and nail art done within the restaurant; great way to keep the children entertained.  Would recommend a visit, but definitely go there hungry.",,
"omg!!! wish there was a restaurant like this at home :( staff are brill and spend time talking to you., entertainment is first class and massive portions too!!! that's why they have a lighter option menu ha ha",,
"This place was great fun...the waiting staff are attentive, and also put on cabaret shows through out the evening which a nice twist.    Now the food...the food is brilliant, perfectly cooked steaks and yummy. However portioms are absolutely massive, share a starter, and there is no need to have the larger portions...trust me on that.    Only suggestions are to have one menu...having 2 is confusing...give me one menu and let me work through it, also make the portions smaller and then you can reduce the price, as the bill was a bit mind blowing.    Aside from that I would definitely recommend fat mamas for a family night out.",,
"Having visited last year and seen more good reviews I decided to give Fat Mama's another chance, unfortunately there is no improvement for me personally. We ordered smaller dishes but it is still just like a Man -v- Food challenge with quantity over quality. We twice visited Gustos which is a 5 minute walk away but the difference is the world away quantity and quality ! I'm sorry but Fat Mama's just isn't for me",,
"Our second visit.....the food is good and plenty of it. I suggest sharing a starter. Good clean family fun, well worth a visit",,
"We visited Fat Mamas on a Saturday evening just out of the busy season, it was still busy with a good atmosphere. The waiting staff were excellent friendly and attentive without being pushy. The entertainment was good fun, primarily a dance group with a bit of singing yet they put on a good show in limited space. Now we come to the food not one but two large menus, large being the operative word when we talk about portions size as well. I foolishly went for a large steak, didn't need it small would have been fine and my daughter had the fudge cake, that took three of us to eat it. As for quality it's fine but it's really all about the size. A good place to go with kids or for an American style and size meal.",,
"Mix of Italian and American cuisine, not really Cypriot, but the best entertainment for all ages. Those with kids love the ad-hoc caberet throughout the evening and the chance to have the children's pictures taken with Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy. Good vfm too.",,
"Western cuisine, no real surprises, portions lived up to the reviews given. Good atmosphere, impromptu performances from dancing girls, all good family fun.",,
"I know from the many times we have visited paphos that this place is very popular, but I have to say I really font get it!    The menu is rather limited, Tex mex or Italian and the prices for what I find to be average food is very expensive. I think its about €10 for a pizza. It also must be one of the only places in Cyprus that does not sell keo beer just Leon, which is like the Cypriot cheaper alternative, only thing is here it isn't any cheaper. I see why the place appeals to families as they have people dressed up and 'entertainement' etc but I have to say both myself and my husband who where out for a nice early evening meal found the whole set up rather tacky! The stafd who dealt with hs where very nice but I fail to see how the place gets so many people on. It was probs one of the most expensive meals we had in our two week holiday and I'm sad to say though it wasn't bad by any means there was nothing memorable about it!",,
"We came here for my birthday with friends and family who came to my wedding a few days before. Having been here before I knew how big the portions were but this was everyone's first time so others decided to have a starter aswell as a main but wished they hadn't as there was so much food!  The food was fantastic and everyone enjoyed the evening. The dancers were also great, it's nice to have some entertainment during the evening.  I can't wait to return when I'm next in Cyprus .",,
"Cocktails were mainly sugar syrup with a dribble of alcohol, cheesy dancing and singing cabaret. Three of our group ordered the large baby back ribs, bearing in mind two of them were 6.5ft guys, they barely finished one rack. Only order the large if you are some Man vs Food monster! I had a chilli chicken escalop with cheese.....it was nothing to write home about. The nachos to start and to share, were huge and the main part of the meal that I enjoyed!",,
ordered two cocktails ( got 4 brought to us as they were BOGOF) a starter to share and 2 main meals. didn't have room to fit in a dessert!! cost 40 euros... a bargain!!!!,,
visited here twice during our stay in paphos excellent food great friendly staff buy one get one free on beer and soft drinks between 5pm and 6 the two for one on cocktails between 6pm and 7would recomend it to anyone,,
"We visited on our last but one evening. had a brilliant meal -the burgers were to die for huge portion sizes and happy to adapt the meals for the most fussy of eaters ( like my son)! lovely cocktails, and you are entertained by singing and dancing as you wait/ eat .Characters came out to met kids , so everyone happy . Meal turned out to be about the same price as else where , but felt we had an all round experience.",,
Fat mamas brilliant excellent food very large portions. Staff excellent & entertainment good. Many other restaurants along the same strip could learn from them ?,,
"Brilliant food and excellent service all with a smile, also cabaret was also excellent. Highly recommended.",,
"We had a beautiful meal here, there was four of us and not one complaint. Staff very friendly also. Had a great night with free entertainment",,
"Massive plate full of good food. We had a starter of onion rings that we probably wouldn't have had had we known abut the portion size but they were freshly cooked light and crisp. I had King prawns in a tomatoey sauce it came with jacket and rice and veg and was yummy, Hubs had chicken fajitas that were huge! We ate early as it was before we came home and got buy one get one free on pints of coke and 10% for eating before 7. recommend it.",,
This was a fab night out - the meals were so big my husband and son had a struggle and thats saying something - they had singing and dancing all during the meal which was fab and kept the younger members of our family entertained as they had some people dressed up.    The service was very good and we were moved when we asked as we were put in the smoking area!!    The staff was very helpful and quick.,,
"Don't eat for 2 days before going here I ordered SMALL ribs and got a full rack - needless to say I didn't finish them, as lovely as they were - it was far too much",,
If you fancy a loud and lively night ..fat mamas is the place for you . The food is very good and you get plenty of it . You will need to book in advance in high season because this is a very popular place. Not the place to go if you're after a quiet meal . Prices are high so take plenty of euros . The ribs are to die for.,,
"Up in Paphos for a few nights and went to Fat Mama's with my sons. The protions were huge and the food was overall not bad. There was a very strange dance routine for someone's birthday by some of the staff, i was probably concentrating too much on the world cup and did not pay attention. Would I go back probably not as the food was was pretty forgettable (and I had the ribs).",,
The place is always busy and the staff are entertaining and efficient and always friendly The food is large portions but not very interesting and there are much better places for food However overal it's a change,,
"If you're hungry then this is the place for you! Portion sizes are huge but the quality was still very good. The ribs are excellent with the meat falling off the bone and the fajitas were excellent too.  The staff really make the place, they're friendly and obviously enjoy their work. It is the kind of place you'd go for a loud, fun meal rather than an intimate dinner for 2. Kids would love the place.  Its not particularly cheap but 2 people could quite happily share most meals the portions were so big.",,
We have been going to Fat Mamas for longer than I care to remember! We spend on average 6 weeks a year in Paphos and have done for the last 11 years.    I have always been a fan and advocate of FM's but on our recent visit we felt that standards had slipped.    The portions are still good...but not as large as they use to be. But I must admit that the introduction of 'half portions' a couple of years ago was a master stroke.    On one recent visit we ordered a side of chips which would normally be enough for 2 or 3 people to share but now it's just a small to average size portion.    And for the first time ever we had to send food back! A basic pasta dish that my wife normally raves about was swimming in water and grease. The other meals were very average but we put it down to eating later than usual. We waited nearly an hour for a table (which was fine as we knew it was busy) but 95% of the people in there were just sat with an empty table waiting for the show. So perhaps the kitchen were winding down.    Still a great restaurant and the show and entertainment is quirky and great fun.    But come on Fat Mamas...don't let your standards and reputation slip!,,
You do get a lot of food but what you can't eat you can take away. It's got a great atmosphere and the staff can't do enough for you.,,
"We've been going to Cyprus for the last 8 years, and initially Fat Mama's was a must stop place. However, over time we have seen the quality of food deterioriate, and we won't be going again. We have also noticed that the queues that used to form no longer do so, so we are obviously not alone in our findings.    Initially, you will be amazed at the size of the portions. The problem is, with a few exceptions, most of the dishes are fairly bland and tasteless. So while you may well get a lot of lasagne, if it doesn't taste very nice, its a bit irrelevent. Now, the ribs are delicious, and if you like ribs you will certainly be in your element, but a lot of the other dishes are just not worth the calories.    With regards to the entertainment, it is really annoying. If you have ever been in Frankie and Bennies when they have a birthday on, then magnify that by 4. Plus, if you are unlucky, they may also pick you as the recipient, whether its your birthday or not. You get a free cocktail for putting up with it, but I would have preferred they just left us alone when it happened to us. If you have never been before then the entertainment probably won't seem to bad, but repeated visits reveal that the entertainment is remarkly formulaic, and doesn't change from evening to evening.    There are much better places to eat than Fat Mama's in Paphos, but at least the staff are friendly when they aren't singing.",,
"The food and service here are both top quality, it's always busy but have never had to queue to get in. The nachos and hot ribs are my partners favourite and mine is the chicken fajitas..they are gorgeous..as are the cocktails. :)",,
"Americanised style dining experience with cabaret - be warned it's rather loud here! Food Is great and well cooked, the staff are good fun and well mannered. Special thanks to Andy!",,
"Went to Fat Mamas on 19 June 2014 as a group of 12 from Zumba Class, we had a great evening, the food was excellent, it all arrived within less than a minute of of the first service all the food was cooked to perfection, the waiters were so attentive and always smiling, and cheerful. The show was excellent the girls singing and dancing for a full 20 mins and on and off in between the meal. We live here in Tala and the first time we have ever been, always thought it was touristy, but how wrong we have been. Would recommend anyone for excellent food reasonably priced and entertainment. Please try even if you live here but thought as I thought just for tourists, how wrong I was.",,
"This eatery is a must to visit where you get cabaret while you eat 4 girls do the show and the kids kids get their photos taken with Fat Mama and cowboy Willie and more importantly the food is fantastic especially the Huntsmans chicken don't miss this one you will regret it, but get there early as it gets very busy. they also do birthdays.",,
"We visited for my daughters 21st birthday and booked a table as it is always busy and you often have to que. I mentioned to the waiter that it was for a 21st birthday. We where half way through our meal, which was excellent and large portions, when the dance troupe came over to our table and sang happy birthday, and presented my daughter with a sparkling cocktail and birthday hat. Thought this was a nice touch that they remembered and found our table for this little treat. It's a bit gimmicky, but the atmosphere is good and lively, the food is excellent too. About average prices. Give it a go if you are on the Tomb of the Kings Rd [about 15 mins walk from the harbour]",,
We visit Fast Mamas every time we visit Paphos and for me is the best restaurant here.  The food is excellent both in quality and size. We ordered a child's meal and when it came it was the size of an adults meals anywhere else. The staff are very friendly and the entertainment is a welcome distraction. We will definitely come back.,,
"Great food, and big portions, very good value for money and good entertainment while you eat too! Would definitely recommend visiting here.",,
"On my recent visit to paphos with my partner we ate here a couple of times. The menu is quite big with a large range of different food including American, Mexican and Italian. The service is very good all staff were nice and polite. You get plenty of food so make sure you are hungry! This restaurant is very popular and for good reason. It's best to get there early or you may find you have no where to sit at all let alone a less desirable table. They start entertainment towards the end of the night usually in the form of dancers which was lovely to watch. Paid a little extra than some of the other restaurants we visited but well worth it! Definitely worth a visit! I will be returning no doubt.",,
"wonderful food and entertainment, get there early or you have to wait, staff very attentive, would have gone more only went on last night, our loss",,
"Amazing food, extremely busy, good entertainment from the staff, bit pricey but would definately say it is worth a visit. The fact that it is always so busy shows how good it is.",,
"Watch out for the portions here, I had a slice of garlic bread and the small ribs and I could hardly get up out of my chair afterwards, let alone attempt a desert. Everyone else's food was also amazing and we all wish we could have managed a desert as they looked incredible from what we could see going to other people's tables. Definitely recommend sharing a main. Go early unless you don't mind a bit of cheesy cabaret during dinner.",,
"Not been here before so was surprised how busy it was Very good and tasty food, and the staff are excellent. Entertainment at 9 from a terrific set of girls. Will definitely go again when l return to Pathos",,
"Excellent food, excellent service and the dance shows every 15 minutes is a blast for the kids! The personnel is excellent with kids! Price... middle to uper",,
"If you are visiting the Paphos area of Cyprus, make sure you go to Fat Mama's on the Tombs of the Kings road. The menu is varied and reasonably priced and you will get more than good service as the team serving you will burst into song and dance routines! For the kids, Fat Mama herself will make an appearance. Don't forget to tell your waiter/waitress if you are celebrating something special as you will get some personal attention too!",,
"The name of the restaurant says it all, you come out feeling full to the top. Good choice of dishes, however would like to see a mixed grill on the menu, staff singing and dancing always a highlight, be prepared to que a little while but worth it in the end, been plenty of times before and if you are over on 31st Oct it's a must visit, booking advisable",,
"A couple of our firends live in cyprus, so we had a reccomendation off them. We booked in advance as we were told it could get very busy.    Portion sizes are very generous! loads of food there so best to go hungry, We went here twice in the week we stayed in Paphos, I had a bacon and cheese burger and pizza, my girlfriend had a half portion of bolognese and the Fajitas! Lovely food, Lovely place.    They have dancers that come out and do a little show evey now and again too.",,
Have eaten here a few times now (love the racks of ribs). My daughter always wants to go back because of the singers. Book or go early cos it's always busy.,,
"Basic food but cant cook pasta, I had the steak chips and beans which were nice. There were also dancers an entertainment which was lovely",,
"stayed at kefalos beach village, went to fat mammas 1st night, food was very good, there was just too much of it, gave me a guilt feeling, having to leave so much.",,
"The best food we had all holiday. Portions are ample, and that is just the small size!! The ribs are the best i've had, meat simply falls off the bone. Steaks are also very good, my girlfriend declared it the best she's ever had!! With the caberet show and the ""birthday dances"" throughout the night and the extremely helpful and friendly staff it makes it a place you have to go to.",,
"This restaurant never fails to provide amazing food. Portion sizes are massive so go hungry. When we first went to Cyprus a few years ago we walked past it thinking it was too touristy as they have ""Fat Mama"" and ""Willy"" and dancing/Singing girls however although it is a little touristy the food and service is amazing.",,
"Went for a meal here 5 adults and 3 kids plenty of choice and variety , kids were given crayons and pictures to colour whilst we waited, Portions very big,quality excellent will be going again next week for a family birthday",,
"Great atmosphere, service very good, food nice i like that you can have a small portion or a cowboy portion (try the cowboy portion ribs) amazing",,
"Well worth a trip. Food portions huge, fresh tasty food and great staff. Very attentive, amusing and good company. Great value for money and the entertainers help to pass the hours away.",,
"Had a excellent meal out last week at Fat Mamas. The food, service, atmosphere and entertainment were great nothing was too much trouble. We had a fab night out and would definitely recommend!",,
"Our rep. suggested we go there for a 'different experience'. Amazing selection on offer,very efficient servers,packed full of very satisfied diners. beautifully cooked and presented meals and exceptionally quick service,the Chefs excelled and were congratulated many times over. We both had sea bass and couldn't fault it or anything else we had. We were surprised by some entertainment.girls singing and dancing at the entrance to the restaurant. A very pleasant evening with a very satisfied tummy!",,
Why did we go here? I still have no idea.  If mass produced american style food is what you are looking for then here it is! if you also enjoy dancing girls leaping out every 5 minutes to do a little dance routine whilst the male staff whoop and shout then this is your place.  food was ok nothing to complain about but nothing to shout about either.  Awful place,,
"Mostly disliked the atmosphere, really loud music and staff clapping (trying but failing to look happy shouting ""oh yeah!""). Basic and poor pizza place which is overpriced. If you fancy a poor interpretation of American diner go here.",,
Found the food to be bland and average. The floor show was out of place and they seem to focus more on gimmicks than food quality. Disappointed as the menu looked really good.    We have been to fat mama's on a previous holiday several years ago and it was great food however that was not this case on this trip.,,
I have visited this restaurant on numerous occasions and the quality has been high every time. The price has been reasonable everytime and the atmosphere has been booming everytime. Be sure to book....this place soon gets busy. If you want a good night out with friends or family...try this place. Oh and abit of advise....try the steak and chips...you wont be disappointed... unless you're vegetarian.,,
"We had been recommended this restaurant by friends and by others in our hotel. We enjoyed our food and time there that much we visited three times in one week!! The staff were always friendly and attentive, entertainment was lively, food was reasonably priced - vast variety and great quality - and was served to us without delay. Would definitely recommend for all to try this place when in Paphos. Servings come in large portions so the 'half servings' were more than enough after a long day sunbathing.",,
"Visited this place twice 10 years ago and now twice on our return this time with our 4 year old daughter, she loves the dancing girls and singing, loves the food, yes portion sizes are big but be sensible and share, ribs were amazing, going again tomorrow for final nights fun and laughter",,
"I can not recommend this venue enough, food big portions and tastie, entertainment amazing, service superb. A must when visiting this resort.",,
"Having eaten mundane food at our 5 star hotel it's was so good to have a 5 star meal at Fat Momma's.  The ribs were to die for and the steak ,the best fillet I have had in a long time.  Entertainment was good and a good night was had by all.  Excellent",,
Family friendly with great service can't fault the food and the atmosphere added to the enjoyment of the night well recommended,,
"staff attentive but not over bearing, food was excellent the cabaret was inspired and very entertaining",,
What can I say we got married in paphos and went to fat mamas 7 times during our stay never a bad me fab entertainment and my daughter ate all her dinner every night as fat mama watched her  Our friends go back in 6 weeks to Cyprus from out wedding party and although staying other side of Island said they will be going for a meal there  You cannot go wrong well done,,
"Part of the build up to any great holiday in Paphos, is planning which night to duck out of an all inclusive package, or for a few visits if you sensibly go B&B in your hotel or apartment. One venue, two menu's. As you would expect, Italian food if you are a pasta lover or Tex-mex, Cowboy Willie style if you are a burger and steak lover. and on both menu's you can choose the size of your portion, with Mama's being a fair size, but a Cowboy Willie portion if you want to skip breakfast the next day. Steaks are always a must . . . .cooked to perfection every time by the Chef's who LOVE to be complimented if you enjoy their food. just ask the Waiter to send your compliments to the Chef ;-). And then there's the floor show each night as well as the birthday, anniversary and party celebrations presented by the entertainment team with a Mama's complimentary cocktail, complete with sparklers . . . . And of course for the younger people with you, as well as those of us who choose never to grow up even if we cancan't prevent growing old, you can get to meet and have your photo taken with the happy couple themselves. Bella Fat Mama and Cowboy Willie himself. Bravo team !!!",,
"Massive portions... Worth a visit ...friendly staff with a small show ,kid friendly , ribs are huge ...",,
The food and service was excellent. The ribs are a must they are very tender and the traditional sauce is delicious. They also do a hot sauce which is also good.  I have also had the steak which was very good. I can say in the in the 5 visits I have never had a poor meal.  The entertainment is good and always enjoyable. good all round family eatery.  Waiting for the next visit.,,
"Had a meal here this week with friends and had a superb experience. Meat platter to share for starters was fab and ample for 4 people. Huge selection of food options and a bonus is the smaller portion option for ladies!    Always visit here when we visit paphos and we would certainly return again. Music and dancing gets a bit too much but maybe we hit the high birthday time so they seemed to come on about every 10 minutes which was a bit disturbing to table conversations, but that's just our opinion.    Overall worth the visit and enjoyed by all",,
"Brilliant restuarant, great value, large portions of food and entertainment thrown in as well. Didnt dislike any of it, well worth a visit",,
"Fun filled and entertaining. If you wish peace and quiet, don't go. It will be a noisy night with dancers, singers and loud music. All in all worthy of a visit it three.",,
"I have recently attended this restaurant with friends and family, I have previously seen all the other reviews about the restaurant.  We waited a while to get into the restaurant, but I know this is the norm, we were eventually seated and again waited a while to order our drinks, which we found expensive, we live in Paphos and have had much cheaper drinks in restaurants. The waitress was a bit off hand when we ordered our food, was a busy night. We again waited a while for it to be delivered.  The food arrived and my wife who had ordered a chicken dish, asked for the vegetables for her meal, she was told it only came with coleslaw, very poor. The food was ok but nothing special. The entertainment does not in my opinion justify the prices charged at this restaurant. I will not be going again for a long time no matter how popular others find it. This is a honest unbiased opinion based on one visit to this restaurant.",,
"We went to Fat Mammas about 8 years ago and really enjoyed it, last night we ventured back with our 3 kids and my Mum. As expected the portions were huge, the food was good and our kids loved the dancing, singing and the visit from Fat Mamma and Cowboy Willy. Well worth a visit if you have kids. They have now added a face painter and nail art lady. We went at around 6.30pm, no queues.",,
"In a town full of restaurants this one stands out - not for the food, but I have to say my salad was delicious but because it goes all out to be different with singing, dancing and characters!! Smiles guaranteed :-))",,
"Have just read some of the other reviews and for that reason felt I should write one. We have been to fat mamas lots of times. It is great fun, the staff are cheerful and welcoming. Fat mama and willy make an appearance, last week we were with my 3 young grandchildren and two of them are nervous of characters, so we just waved them away as they got near, they immediately got the message and waved to us from across the room. The 3 grandchildren loved dancing by our table when the dancing girls came out, and I must say that we joined in. Then if you say to your waiter or waitress 'compliments to the chef' they shout it out, the kitchen staff all shout back 'thank you'. The food probably isn't the best in the world, it is burgers, ribs, chicken etc. But it is fine. In my opinion go as much for the atmosphere as the food. I can imagine height of season the queue can be long, but we have never queued as we always try to find a time when we don't have too. I.e. Because we had the children with us we ate early at just after 6 p.m., so not only was there no queuing but also it was 10% off between 5 - 7 p.m. I would recommend this restaurant to families, and groups of friends. If it is your birthday you get a cake and have happy birthday sung to you, if you get engaged you get a bottle of champagne.",,
"This is a fabulous restaurant, the staff are fantastic and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The food is superb (massive portions, so make sure you are hungry!) and there are kids characters and also a family-friendly dance show during the evening. A meal out and entertainment all in one - brilliant!",,
"Went here with our grandson, he enjoyed the entertainment but it was all too much for us. Food: lots of it but that's about all! Can't understand why it's so popular, must be the fact that they make you queue outside so it looks as if it's really busy. Wouldn't go again! even with children.",,
may be the worst i have restaurant in Paphos we order the ribs and a pizza did not eat either as . do not go to this restaurant the prices are good the atmosphere is good the food is not good.  I do not know why people go to this restaurant,,
"We have two very small children and eating out can sometimes be hard work, these guys made it so easy and kept our kids entertained throughout. The food was great and so much choice and the portions were HUGE! We enjoyed it so much we ate here 4 times in two weeks. To top it all off it was also the cheapest eatery we found!",,
We have visited this fantastic restaurant many times and have never been disappointed with the superb food and service! Once you have eaten sit back and enjoy the Show!! This really is a must visit when in Paphos!!,,
"We went here on holiday, My friend had been a thousand times and had talked and talked about this restaurant, They took me and my my its fantastic! Excellent food Excellent entertainment! its just brilliant. And you have to say compliments to the chef trust me... They run to the kitchen and shout as loud as they can ""compliments to the chef from table 42"" the chefs then shout ""Thank you"" its brilliant!! The food portions are enormous which I loved!    Definitely recommend if your in Paphos must go!!",,
Brilliant night out and ridiculously large portions! Staff are great and really friendly. The entertainment is brilliant. We had nachos and ribs and we had to take some away with us because we couldn't eat it all- and for us that's saying something! We would definitely go back!,,
Fat Mama's is one of my favourite restaurants in Paphos and has never failed me. The huge choice of food items on the menu does not make the restaurant and less efficient and the service is great. At certain times they even have a cabaret. You must try the ribs - they are some of the best I've had!,,
"Fat mamas is not an all year round restaurant. It tends to open around Easter (mid April) and close in the beginning of November. During this period it is one of the most popular restaurantys in Paphos.  It is an excellent place for 'hungry' guys as the portions are substantial. Smaller eaters wil be pleased that for many dishes (pasta etc) you can get a small portion, which I can tell you will not leave many people wanting more.  The staff tends to entertain the eaters with song and dance during the evening and there is face apinting for the kids. The food is typically Italian and Tex-Mex (Ribs, fajitas, barbecue, pasta, pizza etc..). It tends to get very busy around 8pm, so in the busy season (August to mid Sept) it can be good to come a bit earlier. They do NOT accept reservations.",,
Fat mamas is one of paphos best restaurants. Queuing out the door every night which is understandable once you've eaten. Entertainment every night which kept the kids glued for hours,,
"Went to fat mammas for family meal on last night of our holiday. Staff are friendly, didnt have to wait too long for our food. Portion sizes are pretty big, if id have known I wouldnt have ordered a starter!! Lively atmosphere with music and staff doing little dances to grease songs and entertaining diners. Good place for families. They have fat mamma and a cowboy dressed up so kids can have their picture taken with them. Overall food and the atmosphere was good. We enjoyed our meals.",,
"We visited this restaraunt on Halloween night. Fortunately we had booked a table otherwise we wouldn't have got in. It was absolutely packed. In spite of this the service was very quick, friendly and efficient. All the staff were in fancy dress and the atmosphere was amazing. The entertainment was first class finishing with a cabaret showtime. Thanks to everyone at Fat Mamas for a fantistic night",,
"Went to Fat Mammas on Sat 26th October 2013. Went with friends and waited about 5 mins for table., went with friends. We had a great time , good food and entertainment. Would definitely love to go again. Good meal good value. Liz suffolk",,
"At first glance, this place is a diner's paradise. The portions are huge, and if you go early you get a discount plus don't have to sit through the entertainment. But the problems start when you actually get the food.    Sure they are big portions, but some of them taste incredibly bland. I did like the ribs, but the pasta dishes just don't have any flavour at all. I should stress that I've been on more than one occasion. Several over the years in fact. Each time I've been a little bit more disappointed.    One final thing, you may have to put up with them singing an annoying birthday song to somebody. They do this every evening, at more or less the same time. Once they picked me to have a birthday, so I know for certain that its not actually genuine!",,
"portions sizes are ridiculous - i had spaghetti bolognaise which was dry, tasteless & big enough to feed 3 or 4 people. my son had the ribs & couldn't manage to eat more than about a fifth of them- they must chuck away so much uneaten food. Food aside i must mention the entertainment- it was cringeworthy & so loud you couldn't hear yourself think - probably the most bizarre restaurant I have ever eaten at - certainly won't go back- one to avoid at all costs.",,
went here for a meal with with my partner ordered the large portions (mistake) could not finish the meal . We went back 2 nights later ordered 2 small meals still could not finish the meal The meals where Fantasic ***** . A small pasta dish is 4euro 60 cents more than enough and you get a free show .,,
"we found this restaurant very good , it came recommended and didn't disappoint, the food is good, plenty of choice as there are two menu's ,service wasn't bad (happy staff). Basing325 is right about the portions (HUGE).",,
"Ridiculously huge portions!! Unless you have a big appetite skip the starter!! Even the smaller portions are massive. An extensive menu, you can choose from the Fat Mamma menu or an alternative. The entertainment was awful. Three dancers who jump and prance about to spice girls. The foods good but the entertainment lets the place down!!",,
Very disappointed :(  Expensive basic food and drinks.  Entertainment was very basic .  Over 100 people there at 7pm on a Wednesday evening.  Waiter not that happy or friendly.  No way as jolly an atmosphere as a British or American TGI's that they are trying to copy.  They close for winter this coming Saturday and the staff seemed to feel that it can't come quick enough !  Will we go again .... No !,,
"Hi visited Fat Mamas with my family on the last day of our holiday. Arrived at 5pm just as they opened as had to get to airport. We all had burgers, which were good. Service friendly and quick.  On a busy road with building work opposite, not the best view.",,
"Went here on other peoples recommendations and glad we did.Fun, friendly,large menu, massive portions and very tasty food. Dancing girls added to the evening. Will be visiting again next time i'm in Paphos.",,
"Went here on 29th October 2013, really wished we hadn't. Was with my wife and 2 sons 17 & 12. Place always looked busy so we thought we would give it a try, but certainly won't be going back.    FOOD.    What we ate was ok, had better but also had worse, but the portions were just stupid. My 12 year old son likes his ribs, so ordered a ""small"" serving of them .... The plate was so crammed with ribs when it arrived, the 4 of us could easily have struggled to eat it. Now some may say that's a good thing, but for a 12 year old kid it was pathetic and wasteful, NOT impressive as we expect was the aim of the restaurant. I consider myself quite a big eater, but I just felt full and lost my appetite as soon as our food arrived because it was all just too much, Desperate Dan would have struggled.    ENTERTAINMENT.    Where do I start... Absolutely awful. Sporadic 5 minute spells of girls miming and prancing around (all out of sync with each other) to spice girls tracks being played extremely loudly through the house PA system. It was so loud we had to shout at each other across our table of 4 !!!! Then waiters joined in and we had a poorly rehearsed sketch from a musical or pantomime ?? The waiter, who was miming to another deafening ditty through the PA, looked like he'd rather be anywhere but there. It really was POOR POOR POOR.    I'm no snobby food/entertainment critic by any stretch of the imagination, but I really would prefer to have my teeth pulled without anaesthetic than visit this place again.",,
"Visited after seeing good reviews on trip, disappointing to be honest. Food was average, no better than Pizza Express, staff were very attentive, Mojitos were very good and kids were well looked after. If you like things that are a bit fake then you'll like this place, bit of entertainment on, which isn't really necessary in a restaurant. There are far better places to eat.",,
"When we first visited 2 years ago this place was great but think its gone down hill a bit since then. The food is ok if you like TGIs type food but its probably overpriced. The quality of the entertainment is nothing like what it used to be and the ""caberet"" show is basically 3 amateur dancers in home made outfits going through the motions but looking like they'd rather be anywhere else! If you'd paid for dinner and a show you'd be disappointed but as it is its just an ok night out.",,
"Pretty good ribs, monster portions and dancing girls.    Seriously, the potion control is bonkers, I had the small ribs and thought they had got it wrong when they brought out 2 full (UK) size racks.    Lots of ex-pats in for birthdays, so it must be one of the best in the area.",,
"very good happy vibe surrounds this restaurant, with 'show girls' coming out on stage to perform short numbers every so often! the food is very reasonably priced & tastes delicious, the service is great & the restaurant is very clean, it's a bit touristy, bit cheesy, but there's nothing wrong with that every now & again......food portion sizes are HUGE, well worth the money!",,
"We had noticed that Fat Mama's was quite packed on most nights during our holiday, which we thought must be a good sign, so we decided it would be one of the restaurants we must visit!    On the night we went in it was about two thirds full, so we stood at the front entrance (as instructed on the board), and waited to be seated. Unlike Gustoso up the road who just leave you standing at the entrance, the staff at Fat Mama's came to acknowledge us immediately and found us a table of our choice.    There were two extensive menu's available with a huge array of various meat dishes....and the choice of a 'standard' portion or a 'Fat Mama's' portion! My partner went for a steak and I opted for Hunter's chicken, and both meals were of excellent quality, with the 'standard' portion being plenty. We had cocktails to accompany our meal here, and the cocktails were the best that we had during our holiday in Paphos.    The entertainment was what it was, and I can understand why some people have called it cheesy or whatever....three girls dancing to Spice Girls songs might not be to everyone's liking! But as we were sat at the far side of the restaurant we didn't find it to be too intrusive,    I'd highly recommend this place if you're a fan of mouth watering meat dishes....and if you're not keen on the 'cabaret' then ask for a table at the far side!",,
"We have visited this restaurant before when we stayed in Paphos some years ago and returned to celebrate my husband's birthday. It's very American in style with huge portions, but the food is very good and the service very efficient. Some people have complained about the entertainment and I agree it's not 5 star, but actually it made us smile and everybody else seemed to be taking it in the same way. The bottom line is that when we next visit Paphos we will be going back to Fat Mama's.",,
We left eating here until the end of our holiday and we were not disappointed. Yes its a steak house and not a typical Greek style restaurant but we knew that before we went in. The prices are a bit more expensive but the quality and size of the portions reflect this. You can choose from a standard size or go for the Fat Mama's which is huge. The ribs just fall off the bone and the steaks were cooked just how we wanted them.  They lay on some entertainment every night usually consisting off 3 dancers which makes a change from listening to Greek music every night.  Overall the food and service were excellent and will be returning here when we return next year,,
"If you are looking for good food- give this one a miss! It is noisy, expensive and basically an American style steak house. Not good for veges but great if you like chips with everything !",,
"Extensive menu and food was ok, but not cheap. Totally spoiled by 3 ''dancers'' who were accompanied by a couple of the waiters. We couldn't enjoy our meal as they came out and pranced around several times, in the middle of the tables, with 2 bored waiters catching them as they leapt in the air! Tacky!",,
"Ate here twice & found the food & service very good. Huge portions so order accordingly. Our group had pizzas, pasta, ribs & veal plus starters & we were all very happy with the food. Only thing we didn't like was the ""entertainment"". 3 girls who couldn't dance very well & certainly weren't in time joined occasionally by a couple of sheepish looking waiters who looked like they'd been dragged up to dance at a family wedding. On our second visit we sat inside & the volume went up each time they came out & was incredibly loud which set off babies & toddlers crying like car alarms at a firework display.",,
"We went to Fat Mamas 10 years ago and we still chatter about how fabulous the steak was to this day, so when we found ourselves back in Cyprus at the end of September the first place we headed for was here. In some respects it's not changed, they work very hard at the entertainment, but I think this has had a distracting effect on the quality of the food, it was good but in the two weeks we were there we only went once which just goes to show it's lost some of its sparkle, might need to update their ideas a tad  But I still have the fond memories of ten years ago!",,
"Ribs Ribs Ribs. You guested it, the best ribs in town. But before you go ordering a rack for yourself, they are a bit rich so share a portion and don't over-face yourself. All steaks are to die for especially the Steak tournedos Rossini Mmmmmm. The portions are very large so don't be tempted to go for the large option unless your a very big eater. Entertainment all through your meal is great. The staff are very friendly and attentive. But most of all the price is very reasonable. You get what you pay for and with Fat Mama's you get the lot. Just do it.",,
"We've been using this restaurant for over 10 years now on our annual visit to the Paphos area. Not much has changed over the years - service is good, food is OK, prices reasonable and the entertainment gives a good atmosphere, Taken altogether this makes for an enjoyable experience    We are confirmed Fat Mama's fans, but we feel that to some extent the restaurant lives on its past glories. It has seen a steady decline in its TA ranking, reflecting a rather stale format. One thing it should do, we think, is to focus on the food - generally this is good, but our pizzas were cold by the time we were half way through which detracts from the enjoyment, however flavoursome. The entertainment too needs a revamp - it is good to have, but it needs to change and improve    There are lots of good things about this restaurant, for example the welcome, the service and general food quality, so we are not looking for major change - a tweak or 2 here and there would put it back to where it once was",,
"Food very good, service very good, but over rated on the whole. Prices too high could get equally as good if you look around.",,
Great food and great entertainment-always busy but worth the wait. The staff work like clockwork from taking your order through to delivering your bill all with great smiles and great entertainment shows performed by the staff!,,
good atmosphere and ex tasting food.big portions but you can have smaller portions.go early or book a table,,
"Very tasty food we had the steak which was cooked to perfection , always full and lively Would recommend however high-end prices but like everything you get what you pay for.",,
Had an amazing meal....staff were first class and I would definitely recommend a visit....can't wait for a return visit next year!!!,,
"We visited twice during our stay the first time we weren't hungry enough I had the small ribs which were huge and my husband had fajitas both very nice, the second time we went hungry and managed a dessert I has pasta my husband had the hot burger which he said was very hot we had pancakes for dessert which were massive, tasty food good value for money and the floor show entertaining",,
"Amazing food, friendly staff and very child friendly, thoroughly enjoyable, especially the singers !!",,
"We think that if you have young children it would appeal to them,plates piled high,dancers etc and lots going on,but if you are looking for good food and service and value for money there is far better to be had in Paphos. You are always made to wait even though you can see plenty of empty seats,this is a good tactical approach,which always gives you the impression that it is popular and therefore worth waiting for. However we believe it is just a very good idea formed by the restaurant. We would go back again but only if other options were not available!",,
There will be a queue outside so expect to wait but it is worth it. The portions are enormous so go hungry or you will be defeated. Both texmex and Italian are worth every penny and you can order both at the same time . Go with an empty belly. It will be filled,,
"myself and my family ate twice at Fat Mamas, and were not disappointed on either visit, the food and the atmosphere is first class. If it your birthday they have a team of dancers, that do a song and dance for the birthday boy or girl, or any other occasion, also catered for.  You have a choice of two menus, both are excellent i would recommend this establishment to anybody. If on holiday in Paphos. YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE.",,
"A visit here is a must if you are staying in the Paphos or Coral Bay Area. The menu has plenty of variety of well cooked food and ample portion sizes. The entertainment commences when anyone has a birthday or celebration. However, be prepared to queue for a table at this popular diner if you arrive after 7.30 or haven't booked a table",,
"We were recommended to eat at FAT Mammas. Upon arrival the greeting was very welcoming and the staff attentive but that is where it ended.    The 'caberet' is outdated and tacky, the food is bland and far to big with reflecting prices. From personal experience there is only one TGI Friday's and Hard Rock Cafe, which is what they are trying to do here.    We opted for appetisers of:  Potato Skins - OK. Prawn Cocktail - Had better    Entrees:  SMALL Burrito. - Far too spicy even for someone who enjoys mexican food (we tried the Mexican over the road which wiped the floor with this option.    I obviously cant comment on things I didn't eat but the burgers looked greasy and again far too big. Alothough the Pizza did look appetising.    With 2 large separate menus given at the same time with a mix and match anything instruction. Gordon Ramsey would be more than welcome to come sort this Kitchen Nightmare.    I really find it hard to believe how this place for the 10 days we were there was constantly bustling butit was. Maybe with the constant changing clientele.",,
Great location to walk or bus too. The bus goes right outside on the main road and it's a 615. The food was great we were in Cyprus for 14 days and went there several times having different dishes. Every dish was great including desert.,,
Went last year and remembered it being superb but we felt the food standards had dropped!the rattlesnake steak didnt tasts like beef! However the burger i had was amazing,,
"Recommended by a work colleague, we found Fat Mamma's on our second night in Cyprus. This experience confirmed that portions are huge in Cyprus. Steaks delicious and good selection of wine and beer, The ""dancing girls"" were a bit tedious and service was somewhat rushed. Overall we had a good time but found other interesting restaurants during our stay.",,
"The menu here is massive, so much choice, something for everyone. There's always some sort of entertainment going on and when it's someone's birthday or special occasion the dancing girls come out with a cake!",,
"Me and my partner visited Fat Mama's on 2 occasions during our stay in Cyprus and after our second visit my partner even said it was the best meal she had eaten all holiday. There is plenty to chose from on the menu such as ribs, burgers, pizza and various pasta dishes and the potion sizes are huge. The staff are friendly and the girls put on little dances now and again which are fun to watch. I would reccomend Fat Mama's if you want a fun night out with good food.",,
"could not eat all the food as so much,but lovely food and entertainment on whilst dining,always busy so thats a good sign!!!!",,
"Large food portions, food quality ok. Dancing on every night with a show at about 9.30pm. Great entertainment for the kids",,
dancers a bit boring they did not change their routine all evening but food was good with a good atmospher,,
"This is a great restaurant serving a huge and varied menu. The little skits of entertainment by the staff are a lot of fun and were thoroughly enjoyed by my 18 month old grandson who clapped and cheered throughout. This is a very baby friendly place. The portions are big, so go hungry. I would not say the food was the best but it was nice.",,
for portion size and quality great entertainment from the staff dancing and the friendly atmosphere A MUST VISIT,,
"We were told beforehand that the portion sizes are large, but large is an understatement to say the least! The main course we had was the ribs, which were excellent but could have easily fed a family of four! If you are going to eat here (and certainly no reason why you shouldn't) we would recommend sharing a main course between two adults - you will not leave here hungry, take our word for it!",,
"First visited fat mamas five years ago and have visited the restaurant every year since. The menus remain the same old and dated and the quality of the food has declined every year. The entertainment is boring and very very repetitive they need to change this if that want people to keep visiting. Finally the staff are not very attentive, no one asks if your food is ok and they are more interested in rushing out sub standard food. Visiting Cyprus next year and we will not be coming back. Don't trust a repetition that they gained years ago you will be disappointed there are many better restaurants in coral bay and Paphos.",,
The only fault with this restaurant is the size of the portions - (we left half of the 'small portions') - although some people may not consider that a fault. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly and accommodating and there is a nice family friendly atmosphere.,,
"If you want to eat fresh food, and well cooked you should not visit this place. Os fine, because is near a bust stop, near the beach and near the bar street in Coral Bay, but that's all. One of the girls who served us had lack of manners.",,
"the portions here are crazy! I ordered the small ribs yet it was enough for a family of four. I had to check I had the small portion as it was stupidly big. Forget a starter if you want to be able to eat your main.    The food was nice but the portion size,just intimidated me and ruined the meal for me.    The entertainment was also a bit odd. Overly smily 'cabaret' and boys who clearly didn't want to be involved. We hadn't been expecting that. I can see why it is popular with British guests but I doubt i'd return if I Went to Paphos again. It just wasn't my 'scene'.",,
"I've been to paphos loads of times but never been to Fat Mamas so me and my boyfriend thought we would give it a try. Very good service, staff lovely. Had the mussels for start which were lovely and pepperoni pizza for main, pizza was nice but I found the pepperoni to be very grisly and hard to chew. My boyfriend had the King prawns to start which he enjoyed. Then the mamas portion of peppered steak for main which he found too much! A lot went to waste, he said the steak was was lovely though, wish he had had the normal portion though. Overall it was very good value for money but we believe it to be a little overrated. We would return but would defiantly stick to the smaller portions.",,
We were staying in a hotel half board but soon found out the dinner menu was not up to much and soon became hungry for a good feed! We had passed fat mamas a couple of evening and always a large queue stood waiting for a table. We though it must be good if people were prepared to stand in half hour wait lines! And boy were we right! You can choose from two menus Italian and American grill. Make sure you go hungry and you will want to take full advantage of your fat mamas portion. Entertainment though your evening there great for kids.,,
We made a mistake in ordering a sharing nacho platter and a main course. We were full from the starter. I ordered the small enchillada so would be amazed to see what size the large was. Good tasty food. Friendly staff. We ate later in the evening and place was still full.,,
My wife and myself were recommended to go here by the Thomson rep at our hotel in Pathos. She said to get there early as it can get crowded. Walked to it after getting off the bus with other  eateries looking very quiet( It was Monday night ). Even at 7 o clock it was busy with a queue forming just after we were shown our table. The menu which was a choice of American or Italian was fun and filling. We had been warned that the portions can be generous so we both stuck to the normal options which filled us both us. Service was friendly and prices reasonable especially considering the sizes on offer. There was a three girl cabaret style act which was quite entertaining. Also noticeable was the number of parties celebrating birthdays which must mean something. Beer selection was good including the local Leon which is quite pleasant. Well worth a visit.,,
Eaten here before and was 1st class food and entertainment. That was 2 years ago food was ok not as good as before and entertainment not half as good which is a shame as they really put on a good show before 😞,,
Good food at sensible prices. Portions are huge. A few games in the corner to keep kids entertained too.,,
I am surprised at any poor reviews as we ate here 3 times during our holiday. The service and food was excellent each time. The quantities are huge and so sadly we didn't manage to test desserts!! The place is always busy and the staff never stop but are always smiling and friendly. Granted the dancers are very 2 nd rate but even that didn't deter from 3 great nights - would not hesitate to return.,,
"Fantastic service, friendly staff. Massive portions. The ribs just fall off the bone, so succulent and tasty.. definately worth a return visit",,
"Service good, menu is burgers or ribs and everything seems to come with a jacket potato. Has a 'cabaret' show which is bizarre but entertaining. Was recommended to us but not impressed.",,
Everybody raves about Fat Mamas ! You just have to go ! Massive portions and a huge variety on the two menus. The atmosphere is great - don't forget to give compliments to the chef which results in a cheer from the kitchen.,,
"We Had a great time when my family and I visited Fat mamas, the entertainment was great a young lady singing to the people while they ate and dancers dancing around.  The food was fantastic i told the waiter that the burger i had was the best i had ever tasted,  He then shouted in to the kitchen and a BIG HOORAY CAME BACK. then there was more music and dancing.This you must experience for yourself. Very reasonable and good value.",,
"We ended up eating here 3 times in our week long stay, because we loved the bubbly vibe created by the waiters and waitresses, and the dancers. The food was not a la carte, but still very tasy, decent portions, and the service was immaculate. Despite the queues outside, we were seated quickly and our meals arrived within 20 - 30 minutes from first entering the place. If you don't like the lively atmosphere and the cabaret elements, just gto somewhere quieter !",,
"The night before our vow renewal we dined with family here. We were sung to and presented a bottle of champagne. Staff all fab, food amazing. Entertainment for all ages.",,
"We had looked up on trip advisor fat mamas before our holiday and was looking forward to trying it out one night for dinner! On arrival we waited for a table which to be fair was a pretty quick considering it was peak times around 8pm however when we got to our table which was suppose to be for 9 people we was sat at a table for six with added chairs after trying to squeeze on and staff trying to squeeze 3 and half a persons placemats on one tiny table meant for 2 we said we would leave as we were all sitting on top of each one member of group backed into a tree after they then moved us to a more suitable table made for 9 which was free .... Why they put us on that tiny table in the first place I don't know? Maybe as they wanted to squeeze as many big tables as possible! We was then told we couldn't split bills however they could give us a calculator after to work it out didn't find this very accommodating or welcoming especially after already been squeezed on to a table and had to be moved. We didn't end up eating there as we wasn't made to feel welcome or as our custom was valued some staff were friendly however others were clearly rushed of there feet through no fault of there own maybe they were under staffed. I marked the food despise not eating as after looking at the menu I liked that smaller portions were offered for smaller appetites! Entertainment looked good for children however felt it was very similar to TGI Fridays but with not so good service. Shame as we was looking forward to trying there after seeing the crowds and seeing it on the Internet but would rather eat down the road where our custom was valued, food cheaper, drinks half price and a more personal touch to our meal. Not the worst restraint I'm sure however feel that maybe fat mamas are thinking of quantity of customers over quality of service!",,
We passed this restaurant every night for almost 2 weeks before trying it as there were always queue's outisde. The night we went was a little quieter so thankfully no queues.The food was good but quite pricey. They have small acts on every few minutes which was fun and different from all the other restaurants.,,
"We went twice during a weeks holiday, you definitely need to book as people who haven't have to queue to get in, as this restaurant is so popular. The food, staff, entertainment and overall experience here is fantastic. We tried the steak, chilli, sea bass and ribs and can honestly say everything was cooked to perfection and you get absolutely loads on your plate... fantastice place... do not miss this restaurant if your going to paphos or surrrounding areas.!!!",,
Had to queue although several vacant tables clearly visible. Had to wait ages to order and then wrong order was brought to our table. At the end they had added 14 Euros worth of drinks that we hadn't had. Need to concentrate on running a restaurant rather than a poor man's X Factor.,,
"We visited Fat Mammas on the first night of our holiday. There was 5 of us, 4 adults and 1 child. We have been before last year and enjoyed it. We went out to celebrate my mums birthday. We were greeted at the door by friendly staff who showed us to a table. We were given the two different menus to look through. We decided to give the starters a miss as we knew from previously that portions were big. My daughter and i had the fajitas, my husband and dad had the chilli, my mum had the canaloni. All the mains were delicious. My daughter, dad and i still had a little room to squeeze in a yummy dessert too. We enjoyed the entertainment and my daughter enjoyed watching the dancers sing happy birthday to her nan. Great night. Good value for money at €115 including drinks. Will definately visit again this holiday.",,
"although not rated amazing this ya the third time back in 3 years - go coz the amount if food is huge but the bill for 6 of us for starters and mains with soft stu is was 260 euros. The staff are brilliant, friendly and of course entertaining. No doubt we will go back again next year though.......",,
The food was amazing and you get really good value for money! The waitress came out and danced 3 times whilst being there which was really good entertainment! Visited twice whilst being in pathos and both times it was fabulous. Deffinatly the best resturant in pathos!,,
"Think a lot of people might walk past this place thinking that it's not their cup f tea but, believe me, you need to try it. The food was excellent, as was the service and the entertainment.",,
Wide selection of food. Choice of portions large or small. Well presented . Very modern yet traditional. Great staff smiley happy easy going and lots of staff didn't have to wait for someone to walk by . Very reasonably priced too with special offers too.,,
"My partner and I were a little baffled at why this place was always so packed as it quite simply offers your run-of-the-mill American/Italian fare which you could get in somewhere like TGI Friday. We ate here on our last day in Paphos around 5pm when there were very few people there, as we wanted to see what all the fuss was about. It wasn't anything special to be perfectly honest. Steak was cooked well but accompanying vegetables were cold and greasy. We ordered the small portion which was more than enough for us so wouldn't want to think what this larger portions are like.    This place seems to be the kind of place that children would like to eat at as it has many dishes that they would be comfortable eating rather than some of the local tavernas.",,
A must go and visit in Paphos. Great food and atmosphere and good value too. Ribs and Pizza have got to be tried!    Gets very busy so go before 6.30/7pm and get a good table and discount for being an early bird.    We thought the dancing girl family entertainment made the evening and not to be missed!,,
Food is just like the equivalent of TGI Fridays or Filling station back here in the UK but slightly less quality and taste. Portions are quite big though. The have constant performances from the waiters which is rather annoying and horrible to be honest.,,
"Fab place to eat! Meals are delicious, portions are more than generous (even the smaller portions are pretty big) and the entertainment is great!",,
We had seen this restaurant on a previous visit to pathos but the queue had put us off. This time we got there for 7_30 and hardly had to wait. We had read about portions begin huge so stayed away from the main menu. We had a lovely chicken dish. The food was very good but we certainly didn't need anything else to eat. The queues do build up very quickly but if you visit pathos it's something that must be done.,,
"Ribs were great as well as the burgers, the waitresses cone out and dance and sing every 20 min which is fun ! You get 2 menus Italian and American so u can't go wrong ! So much choice definitely go here",,
"Can be a bit cramped due to being so popular, but the food is OK and you get free entertainment while eating. Would recommend at least one visit.",,
"Steak was outstanding, perfectly cooked and so tasty. The ribs were also really good.  Five days left and this is the only place I am looking forward to visiting again.    If you like good meat and other Italian dishes, you have to try here....but go early....get there by 7:00pm to get a good table.",,
food is the best try to book a table there is a long wait if u don't book try the ribs they are out of this world great staff,,
We heard lots of good things about this restaurant. Luckily we didn't have to queue up like lots of other people. Good service and the food was nice but I can't honestly see what all the raving was about. It was fine but I don't know if I would go back.,,
"Visited with friends one evening and looking at previous reviews I think it depends on what you order as to the size and taste of items. Most of us had starters and ribs off the American menu and personally, I wouldn't go to this establishment if I wanted a bowl f pasta for 9 euros at least paying 9 euros for ribs you get a decent amount with fries and didn't think the cost was too bad.    Great for families and groups as lots of choice, would go again if visiting Cyprus in the future. Great atmosphere.",,
"Whilst we only ate here once whilst on holiday in Paphos, the food was good and the entertainment enjoyable.",,
"Had a great night there this week, huge portions of ribs even for the kids portions! The dancers and entertainment are good. Because its peak season we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table but that was no major problem. We didn't order a starter and the waiter said it would be a thirty minute wait for the main course, again not a major problem and it was less than that. Great atmosphere and will go again.",,
"Friendly staff, varied entertainment, average food, very reasonable prices, easy to find on the Tomb of the Kings Road",,
Visited twice during our stay. Absolutely HUGE portions and very tasty food! The waiters are great and really make an effort. A team of dancing girls break out about once every 15 mins ! Very good nite !,,
"Entertainment was funny - for kids. Nice service, but food not so great. Kidspizza did not taste at all. The rest of the food was saltless. I would not go back.",,
"If you ever go Paphos Cyprus take a visit to Fat Mamas It is great although you have to get there early, the rep in our hotel told us it was best to go on a week night and we went on Tuesday at around 6.30 and the queue started just after that. the portions are huge and the staff very friendly the only thing about it was I asked for no onion in my burger and got onion but nothing major. I have visited this place twice now and if I was to go to Cyprus again I would definitely go again. Worth a try to anyone!!!",,
"When you look up and down the street of Paphos you will find many restaurants - some with and some without customers.    When you look at Fat Mama's you will see a restaurant that is full almost every night from March when it opens until Halloween when it closes.    It's not fine dining, but then it doesn't pretend to be. What it is, is a good restaurant, serving excellent food, good portions (read big) and at very reasonable prices.    In between serving you, some of the girls and boys put on mini-shows that keep people entertained throughout the night. if it's your birthday, anniversary, wedding or any other special event, then you will also be honoured.    You will have to queue up a little while, but not for too long as there are many tables. Tex-Mex or Italian - the choice is yours, but what you will get is a fun-filled evening with good food.    ENJOY!",,
We had a recommendation to go to this restaurant and we loved it so much we went twice during our stay in paphos. The food is amazing and the portions are large! Although it was a bit more expensive than other meals we had on the holiday it was worth it. The ribs were great and the fajitas piled high on the sizzle plate. The staff were great and if its your birthday they sing and dance for you and also have a cabaret. A great atmosphere in this restaurant well worth a visit .,,
"We had to queue for a few minutes before we were seated - it was very busy - have been before so know how big the portion sizes are, yet still had to check that yes the ribs were the starter portion for my husband - Cowboy Willy and Fat Mama made an appearance which the kids love. It is a great nights entertainment and my kids look forward to going every year - I would recommend for families with kids.",,
This restaurant had been recommended by a colleague of my husband's and was well worth the visit. We didn't have to queue but think we were lucky. Queues went down very quickly though. The food was excellent especially the ribs. Amazing that some of the staff jumped between serving tables and then singing and dancing to entertain the diners. They were very good. Initially though it was pricey but when I converted from Euros to pounds it wasn't that bad. We were £88 for three courses and two rounds of drink for 3 people. You can easily spend that at home and the food isn't as good. Worth a visit.,,
"Wasn't sure about going because didn't like the idea of queueing outside the restaurant but only waited 5 minute for a table , was a little pricey but we had a nice meal and the ribs are massive",,
"We had a meal here and enjoyed what we were served. Generous portions and decent service. A wide range of food available so something for everyone. They give you two menus to choose from, which is somewhat confusing as there are things like different types of steak on each menu, so you have to review both carefully to get a full picture of what’s available",,
"Went again this evening, the food at this place is nice, over rated but affordable, we were served food on chipped plates and bowls, we asked to sit in the 'no smoking section' only to have smokers sitting directly behind us.  The food is good but due to the damaged crockery and smokers it unlikely we'd go back as there are other restaurants next door that serve just as yummy food",,
"Just been to fat mama's again with friends and had a great night. Word of warning go there hungry  As the portions are generous! The food was excellent ..i had mussels for a starter and seafood pasta,my friend is allergic to gluten and the chef was able to advise and create dressings especially for her with no fuss. Try the ribs if you have a big appetite and the chili may not have been the wisest of choices for a hot summer's nite as it was nice and hot served with chips and rice....did not get to sample the desserts as we were already full up but they looked lovely...    As for the atmosphere lots of people there for birthdays and forthcoming nuptial so a party atmosphere..the kids can get facepaints and photos with fat mama and the singer's and dancers put on a great show despite the humidity .    So if you are in paphos this summer join the queue to get a table it's worth the wait!",,
"An excellent menu (spoilt for choice) and massive portions! The staff are brilliant, with the bonus of in-house musical entertainment. It's always full; a sure sign that they are getting everything right.",,
the food is fab its american diner and italian rolled into one.this place is so popular there are ques from 7pm every night,,
"Fat mamas is on of the best restrants I have ever been to we first passed it 1 day after we had landed in Paphos and it was packed so we thought we would go there for a meal.  When we first got there there was a queue wich we thought we where going to have to wait a long while but a waiter asked if we would like to go to the bar while we where waiting so we got to the bar had our drinks made which where amazing with fancy sparklers in them and 2mins after having them we where guided to our table which is when we sat down and looked at there menus just after he gave us our menus he said the portions are big which is what pleased me !! On the menu was loads of good choices from kids to adult meals and from Italian and American meals to choose from so really good food but what we didn't know there was entertainment which was very very good from sing to dancing the entertainment just got the restrant off to a tee for me which was a good surprise for us at the end, once our meals arrived we where shocked they where huge and delicious and desserts where just as good but right at the end there was a caberlay performance which was non expected I won't say much more or it might spoil it for you oo and one last thing if your having a birthday Orr celebration ie wedding goo there because when we went there was 7 b days and 2 weddings and they really celebrate It.  Overal this is an amazing restrant with a happy exiting atmosphere with good food and entertainment I would highly recommend this place to anyone",,
"firstly, get there early or else you would have to queue. food was excellent couldn't fault. very overpriced but you have entertainment with singing and dancing. a nice change",,
Brilliant. The efforts they go to to make your meal memorable are outstanding. Great food and entertainment to match.,,
Queued for ages despite empty tables. Burger was undercooked and bloody. Salad limp. Chips overcooked and like rubber. I ate a quarter and gave up. My husband had a different meal but we have both been I'll. Luckily my meal was so awful they didn't charge. The show was a huge disappointment. The toilets were dirty and smelly. The staff were friendly and helpful so that brings my rating up to 2,,
"Excellent menu; plenty of choice plus size options (half portion of fab pastas is plenty for most, but huge plates available if opt for beautiful fresh cooked burgers with a million fries from Willy's side of restaurant. Get there before 9pm to enjoy team of waiters & waitresses dancing to entertain you - quite upmarket Redcoats (for those who recall Butlins!!) Pleasant way to spend a warm holiday evening. And all staff lovely!",,
"We all had a great night, food amazing and service 1st class..... Well worth cueing to get in. We had dinner on two occasions and both times were great. Kids loved the food and entertainment also. Great night for all the family.",,
"Went quite early as dining with my girls (about 7.30ish..) there were empty tables but still had a 5 min wait to be seated!  The starters were ok though, although my daughter who usually loves her garlic bread with cheese was unimpressed!  I had a chicken burger which was really nice, chips pre salted though n a little salty, no side salad to speak of.. Unless you count 2 pieces of lettuce!  My girls eat their meals without complaint.  The dancing/singing was slightly cringeworthy. With their outfits badly needing to be replaced! All worn/ripped/dirty.  Not value for money here. Overpriced for what you get.",,
great atmosphere.great value for money! entertainment while u eat is great. although people queue to get in on an evening it is well worth the wait. Beware the portions are enormous.,,
"This place has an American and an 'Italian' menu. We started badly when the cocktails were tasteless. Our starters were even worse, mussels with a congealed sauce that looked like vomit and a cheap, mass produced bread roll. The baked mushrooms were baked with cheese, I have cooked better at home. The pasta dishes were adequate but with too much sauce and were of an amateur attempt.    The entertainment was irritating but I suspect the restaurant may have been better for burgers etc. May be suitable for kids. I cannot recommend.",,
"This is what it is. If you want fine dining this may not be for you. If you want burgers, steaks, ribs or pizza etc and a fantastic family restaurant this is the place in Paphos. The service is friendly and efficient. Ribs are the best I've had!    Kids love it, well worth a visit! Does get busy and you may have to wait a while to be seated but worth the wait at least once during a visit to Paphos.    Better value than most other restaurants in area",,
"I should have walked straight by as alarm bells were ringing but a friend said the food was great. The sparklers in all the drinks and ice creams etc did not hide the fact the cocktails were really poor. My starter was appalling and was served with a white supermarket bap not proper bread. The waiter did, however, suggest a half portion when I ordered pasta and this was just as well as it was massive. The sauce was ok but overall the meal was my worst yet on the island!!!",,
"fat mammas is a must to visit when in paphos, though slightly more pricey than other restaurants you cn now get smaller portions which are still too big. great family atmosphere and extremely child friendly",,
"A great restaraunt! The delicious meals are affordable and very generous. The staff are polite and are always fast in serving. The entertainment was fabulous to watch, and listen to. Had to que for a table but no wonder people were queing; a great place to have a delicious meal. would love to go again!",,
"Fat Mama's is busy (get over it) cos it's good! We went in before 7.30 (twice in one week) so got 10% off our bill and didn't have to wait for a table. We had nacho's to share which was big enough for 4 and garlic bread. Then a lovely (massive) burger with lots of cheese and different sauces on so couldn't eat it all. Next time had a ""small"" spaghetti bolognaise which was massive! Seemed expensive but not after the experience in other restaurants, was recommended to me and glad we went!!",,
"Always a very busy restaurant when you pass , always queuing outside for a table!  We visited here a week or so ago after a lot of people said the food was great!  We thought the food was excellent with a huge range of dishes available , portions are available in small or large which we thought was a great idea altought small was still quite large!.The staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome , the entertainment wasn't too bad but not a great deal went on till very late at night but its usually too busy then to get in for a table for a meal , overall very good experience and will go back again when net visiting Cyprus x",,
Pretty terrible. Very expensive.    Brochette starter was 4 large slices of garlic bread with chopped tomatoes on top - would happily swap quantity for some quality.    Fajitas were mainly a pile of vegetables - we had steak and chicken fajitas - they were massive but meat was very much in the minority.    On the plus side, our son's pizza was good and the staff were friendly if uncoordinated.,
"This place is always busy, sometimes a queue to get in, we tried it and were disappointed. The staff were great, a good fun atmosphere, ample choice but the food was bland and tasteless. My husband and son had the ribs, massive portions ( they ordered the small so goodness knows how large the large is) both were very underwhelmed. My son had the ribs at the farmhouse tavern (just down the road) and he rated them MUCH more. Reasonable prices for the size of the portions, we had a fun night, enjoyed the dancers, and Romona our waitress was lovely and attentive.",,
"We had to book to get into Fat Mama's, it was my friends birthday and we had a wonderful time, the staff were great nothing to was to small or big, they were happy to do it. the food was amazing! we couldn't eat it all....potions were huge, and the food was cook to everyone liking, i have been back many time and i out there in two weeks and will be going again...",,
I enjoyed the restaurant the food was only average though and rather on the cold side. Staff are constantly swooping around which is very off putting. One girl walked around the restaurant at least 10 times but the funny thing was she never had anything to deliver nor did she clear away? Strange,,
"We stayed in Ayia Napa but travelled all the way to Paphos for the day and night so we could have a Fat Mama's as it was my girlfriends favourite restaurant when she went to Cyprus 2 years ago. 2 hour drive and thank fully it didnt disappoint. It was the same as 2 years before. Amazing food, great value, huge portion, entertaining staff, very friendly place to go. Think if we were in Paphos we would have visited a few more times. Anyone going to Cyprus and heading Paphos way i would recommend this restaurant! Superb!!",,
"Can't fault the service, very swift if a little robotic. The size of the portions is what I imagine brings people to this place because it can't be the quality of the food. There is a mexican restaurant further down the street that does much more authentic and tastier food that Fat Mama's provides. Maybe I am not their target demographic being in my late 30's but I wouldn't go back.",,
"Great atmosphere,very good food, the team of staff that put on the shows deserve a big pat on the back also. very popular,queues most nights,best book if you want to eat after 7pm",,
"Make sure you go hungry when you book at Fat Mama's. With potion sizes large enough for two, this friendly, happy atmosphere, you'll be sure to enjoy your time here. Make sure you pay completements to the chef, you'll be greated with a great surprise if you do. If its your birthday or someone you are with, make sure you let the waiting staff know as they'll put on a show for you as you dine in celebration.",,
"food portions are massive,they have entertainment on fun and cheesy great if its a special occasion.the chilli bowl a must,the garlic cheese bread a small loaf and the large ribs a challenge.",,
"Amazing fresh food, friendly staff and good entertainment! Free drink is given for birthdays/ anniversary's etc along with 3 girls dressing up and dancing to the birthday person/couple. Good quality food for reasonable prices!",,
"As a food critic, difficult to please most of the time because of my job, I do not find any difficulty whatsoever to compliment the chef at Fat Mamas for an excellent meal last week. The staff was of very good standard, most languages spoken, and the surprising entertainment was great. The manager himself Mr Alex, very active in all fields, welcomes people that the entrance and places them at the tables giving the personal touch to the dining procedure. The double menu gives the customer a wide variety of choices and I must say that the dishes were the biggest I have seen in any restaurant around Paphos. The restaurant was sparkling clean in spite the busy evening. The fact that people wait in a queue to be seated shows very well how successful the restaurant is, a criterion for any foreign visitor who doesn't really know where to go in order to dine out. All this at the right price results in good value for money. Well done Alex, keep it up!",,
"Was looking forward to our trip to fat mamas and it didnt disappoint us food was amazing yes the ribs are massive one of us attempted them and succeeded thought we were going to need a wheelbarrow to remove him afterwards though lol we had steaks ,hunters chicken,spaghetti bolognaise,chicken every meal was as good as the next large portions and very tasty the only minor let down was the poor entertainment girls in very tatty old costumes coming out every so often dancing kind of lowered the tone but we went to eat and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it would def reccommend visiting you get your moneysworth and more looking forward to next year",,
I visited here on a family holiday when I was twelve and loved it. I recently returned with my partner. The food is average but good value. I imagine this is perfect for families. There is regular entertainmed. It is a bit cringe but one of the dancers was very good. The only bad thing was one of the blonde singers who sounded awfull! sorry! I think she sang Spice girls maby viva forever? not good :(,,
"Heard about this restaurant through friends and decided to give it a try, glad we did!  Absolutely massive portions and very reasonably priced. The spontaneous mid meal entertainment was fantastic too. You need to get in early, 10% discount if your sitting down betwenn 6-7pm, not that you need it! its very cheap anyway! but theres always a huge queue to get in after 7!    We'll definitely be going back when we return to phos!",,
"Not the best food in Paphos (not the worst too!!) but with plenty of choice and smaller portion options, my four year old daughter begged for us to go back. The highlight for her was the dancers and Fat Mama and the cowboy in costume. Abit cringe-worthy entertainment but the kids loved and people were queuing out of the door waiting for a table!",,
Really wish we had a restrunt like this back home...amazing food fab sevice and good entertainment. Food was out of this world.,,
"It's a restaurant that has two different menus. Italian menu with pastas, and american food with burgers,steaks,ribs etc.  I reccomend going for the grill menu which is magnificent. The burgers are very tasty. The atmosphere is rally good , and it has live show with girls but not all hours.  However i find it a bit expensive to go there everyday.",,
"This is a great restaurant and one of the most popular ones in paphos ! The choice of two different menus is great too, Italian and American ! The prices are very reasonable also for the amount of food you get and the quality. The burgers are great !!  I especially love the entertainment. If you have a birthday or anniversary they will sing and dance n bring over a cocktail ! The cabaret about 9 o'clock is excellent also. You can tell they love what they are doing.  Even though its not Cypriot food fat mamas is a definite to try",,
"Went here on a recommendation & very glad we did. Food was really tasty & big portions. Gets very busy so would advise going a bit early to avoid queue. Two menus to choose from & you can mix & match from each. Something for everyone on the menu. Had steak & it was cooked perfectly. The service was great. Attentive staff but not in your face. Food was quick. The only downside for us was the entertainment. Music plays then all of a sudden a song comes on, very loud & a group of people come out dressed up, perform a dance & then go to a table for a happy birthday song. This happened 4 times when we were there & kind of interrupted our nice, quiet meal out - annoying for us but may not be for others & understand it just might have been a busy birthday night! The kids would love the sporadic entertainment but just not to my taste. Don't let it put you off though as the food is worth the visit. Think the prices are slightly too high, but again worth visiting at least once on your trip.",,
"Went here with some people we met on holiday. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were very attentive. Ordered a starter and main course but really should have had just a main. The portions were just too big so impossible to eat,. Everyone leaves with a doggy bag. The food was of a good quality, but when we got the bill at the end of the evening I though it was just too expensive for what we got which is a shame. I've been there and done it now so don't feel the need to do it again.",,
There are two menus for this place fat mamas which is Italian and Cowboy Willys which is American.. Both menus can be used for instance starter off one dessert etc off another portions are big all this is explained when you are seated have you been before etc I always have a starter portion of Nachos and chilli for main course it's also available as a veg option too.. Steaks burgers ribs are all excellent whilst you are waiting there is entertainment on in the form of waitresses dancing along to songs it's a loud place that is great for families and couples alike. Yes you may have to queue later on in the evening it's a busy popular place but well worth a visit even if its just to see the look on a persons face when a huge plate of ribs for starter arrives ...,,
Food was just standard-entertainment was terrible-funny to see but absolute rubbish! Don't order steak-it was tiny,,
"We had 2 meals here, there is a choice of either american of Italian, we went for the latter choice and were not disapointed, it was done to perfection, and both time sent out compliments to the chef. The staff were very freindly and helpful, although as mentioned in another review, the 8 pm entertainment was a litte on the naff side, but the children loved it with fat momma and cowboy willy. If you decide to go, make it early as when we left, there was always a queue waiting for a table.",,
this restaurant was great food was bril portions large go for nachos for a starter the plate was really big and the ribs were even bigger kids enjoyed food to,,
"We came here on our first night of our holiday and thought it was amazing, returned again well into our 2nd week to find the service terrible, when the bone thin waitress took my girlfriends order and asked chips jacket or salad, my girlfriend said chips, she pulled a face and said ""not salad?"" Which my girlfriend resaid chips, and again said ""...so no salad"" which then made my girlfriend feel terrible! When we had finished (it was lovely and filling) my girlfriend had left some and the waiter asked ""oh so you didn't like it"" with attitude and she simply said she was full to which he shrugged and said ""I was joking"". We won't be returning. One times enough to recieve such rude service!!",,
We recently came back from Paphos Cyprus and we ate in Fat Mamas twice in a week the resturant is lovely the food is the best quality i have ever tasted and i have been to many resturants in england and abroard i would advise get there early as people are queing to get in the doors,,
"This is like a pathos version of frankie and bennys  The food is lovely, portion sizes are very big. Can be pricey but for the quality and quantity off food not to bad.  Entertainment is brilliant and very entertaining.  Would defiantly recommend a visit to fat mamas",,
good food and a bit of a show going on throughout ...the portions are on the large side so no starters but they do a small potion option these days for people with normal appetites ....i would recommend the rack of ribs you are in for a treat and good luck,,
"Visited the restaurant after reading good comments.I was told that the portions were big so,not big at all just normal portions you will find at any restaurant.Prices were ok but expected more value for money.The staff is waiter and entertainer a bit of both,but do not listen want customers want I asked for our drinks to be with no ice and they gave them to us with ice when I asked the waitress to change them she's asks what is the reason I want with no ice,which I found very rude. In general been but not going again.",,
"would never go back to this restaurant. Had seen that the place had been very busy and had a good reputation however upon arrival we were made to queue outside the restaurant on the pavement even though there were plenty of empty tables and staff kept looking over but failed to even acknowledge that we were there. We were finally seated and not explained to us that there were 2 different menus causing confusion when discussing which food we wanted. I chose the hunters chicken while my partner chose the ribs. When the food arrived my partner was in shock to find a very unappetising plate of ribs (we expected a rack of pork ribs instead they were beef) with the chips on a side plate rather than with the main meal. There were no other sides provided (coleslaw or peas would have been nice). The hunters chicken was on a plate that was so hot the cheese was actually stuck to the plate surrounded by grease. Neither of us enjoyed our food and the service was very poor, it seemed that the staff were more interested in the entertainment than serving the customers and providing nice food. Would never go here again!",,
Great food great portion size great prices for the amount you get entertainment is good but gets annoying after a while drinks are bit pricey but food more than makes up for it try the ribs cowboy portion or fat mammas portion of carbonara if u like a challenge you will not leave hungry and your taste buds will love u,,
We ended up at far mama's one afternoon as it was very near our hotel and had seen a huge queue there before. We were waited on by a host of british staff and served some great america food. This resturant is great if you are after a burger!,,
This retraunt was recommended to us but we found the food was poor quality (although plenty of it!).,,
"An excellent meal with a little entertainment to break up the meal. Staff very friendly, place was clean",,
"Before we got to Cyprus EVERYONE told us to head to Fat Mamas, so we did on the first night. Well and truly lived up to the hype. We stupidly ordered the nacho starter, what were we thinking?! As a,axing as it was the portions were enormous and fitting the main in was impossible. The entertainment was hilarious. We had fajitas and BBQ chicken, washed down with desperadoes and piña coladas. Can't wait to return!",,
"I'd read a lot of reports of this restaurant on tripadvisor and other places. Walked past a few times and there was always a queue outside. We decided to give it a go. We got there and there was no queue and seemed to be plenty of room if you were happy to sit under cover. While at the restaurant we did see queues but these were soon sorted out and there was only a delay of a few minutes, so don't be put off if you see others waiting.  There was two menus one with Italian style food the other American. I must admit I was a little disappointed but we gave it a go and weren't disappointed with the food. We both went for a small portions and glad we did. If you want a really big portion then you wouldn't leave hungry. The food was of a very good quality and was well worth the money and outstanding value. My wife loves her puddings but didn't have space for one. We were well and truly stuffed. The staff were probably the best we had during our visit. The entertainment wasn't the best but were still quite good. The whole place was very clean and the staff knew exactly what to do and they looked to be a happy hard working team. Visit, you won't be dissappoined",,
"Food portions here are MASSIVE, really delicious and they put on entertainment while you eat which is great. Staff are friendly and helpful and it is really good value for money",,
"Food very good, i had a lasagne which was very fresh, huge portion, we made very welcome by the staff who were very pleasant, will definitely go back on my next visit!",,
The food was excellent shame about piece of glass in my mussels would still go again in July when we are back intertainment very good wine very good,,
"Good food, superb, friendly service. All waiters/waitresses speak good english. Live entertainment and if it's your birthday, you're in for a treat!",,
"What a venue! Great food (huge portions), great service and good entertainment added to the mix. Highly recommended.",,
"Fat Mammas reminds me of those lively singalong restaurants on the Disney parks.... If that's your style this place will not disappoint you.    The food is good American fare .... Plenty of burgers, pizza, ribs and meats ...    The entertainment is fun with lots of timeout moments when the staff break into dance or costume characters hit the floor..    A very lively evening.    If your looking for a quiet meal for two or more this is not your place ...",,
"Well all I can say about this place is that if you want a nice burger this is the place to go but for anything else do not bother, the entrainment was shocking with one of singing(well a girl laughing while trying to sing) and some acts I can't quite understand what to do with the restaurant, my bf did bit enjoy his food and said it was to sickly. We asked for the bill twice as the first girl said ok and still 20 mins later we was still waiting for it.",,
"We visited this place last year and we liked it so we gave it another try.  It was just as we remembered. Good food, great service and a lovely show to entertain you while you eat!  If you plan on going you must try the enchilada!!!! It is to die for!",,
"We went to fat Mamas 5 times in our 2 week stay. The food is out of this world well priced compared to other restaurants in this area. The caberet is a bit cheesy but has something happening every half hour which kept our children entertained.  There is an amzing choice of foods to suit anybody. The place is spotless, service amazing . Well done to fat mamas would highly recommend",,
"We were entertained by some young dancing girls who were OK, but all felt very Am dram. Food portions were large, I took most of mine",,
"This is the American dream right in the heart of Paphos. We ordered a burger each which was literally too big to pick up and eat, and we only just about finished, certainly no need for starters!  The staff put on a cabaret show which was amateurish but was done with a light heartedness.  I think for the area there are better priced restaurants and also the local food is much tastier than the American fare, however if you're looking for ""home food"" this is the place for you",,
"This place is all about the American experience, the portions are huge and the staff entertain you although the ""have a nice day mentality becomes a bit tiresome"" as does the constant shout outs for people's special occasions. I could understand a couple getting married the following day but a 9th wedding anniversary or a couple getting married the next week !! The food is ok but there is just too much. The ribs were tasty but even sharing 4 racks as a starter becomes very sameish, similarlly who asks for 4 enchiladas for a main course ! it was more like an episode of Man versus Food. I am sure that some people will love this but I hate to think how much food gets thrown away each day.",,
"This place is both amazing for food and entertainment!! Food is out of this world ate here twice and couldn't find fault either time, staff so friendly and happy, nothing is too much trouble, highly recommend if you're staying in Paphos to try here at least once :-)",,
6 of us managed to get in here after quite a wait outside but it was worth it  The place was pretty much full which speaks volumes in paphos  They have 2 menus one is American i.e steaks and ribs and the other is Italian  they also have the option of ordering a huge version of certain items but be warned the ribs are enormous!!  The dancers were good and provided great entertainment  The restaurant is quite a distance from the harbor area but its worth the taxi/bus cost  It is one of the most entertaining meals we've had,,
"We have been here previously and enjoyed the food and entertainment. We decided to take some friends this year. As always the food is of a good quality at a fair price. The service is excellent and they offer smaller portions which are still big! The small entertainment interruptions during the meal are always welcome, but this time we got to see the cabaret, which is on after 9.00 pm. Well worth watching and full marks to the performers/waiters for a great show. The staff take an interest in you and are willing to spend time chatting.    Interestingly the restaurant was busy and you had to wait for a table, yet the restaurants either side were empty. They certainly have the winning formula, keep it up.",,
was one of the busy ones always full but not my kind of place food was good enough if you like american and italian but most of the most popular ones in the area,,
"Fat Mama's was just down from where we were staying and I had seen the reviews on Trip Adviser before we went - thanks to those who posted before! Nice meal, big portions, cheesy entertainment - what more could you want!",,
"Visited twice in our one week stay in Paphos!  By far the best food we had :)  Staff are all very lovely and helpful, and the entertainment is great!  I would recommend the Ribs, they are amazing!  Would definitely return when we visit Paphos again :D",,
"Friendly staff, excellent food and good value sums it up. It was great fun for kids too with dancers and singers and fat mama and cowboy willy photo opportunity as well all before 7:30 pm. 10% discount for early diners was an added bonus we didn't know about. Our 2 are 3 and 5 yrs and enjoyed their meal too. My hubby loves ribs and had the biggest plate of ribs ever! 24 I think. He didn't manage them all!",,
"My wife and I are in Paphos on holiday, and were recommended Fat Mamas by another guest in our hotel. I have to say that it didn't sound like the usual type of restaurant that we would visit, but we decided to have a look.    We arrived at about 730pm, and already a queue was forming outside. Don't let that put you off though as the turnover of people is such that there is never much of a wait from what we could see.    The staff were courteous, professional and fun. There was always some form of interaction going on, whether it be celebrating a birthday, wedding anniversary or simply the excellent entertainment that the staff were putting on.    The food was good, not great, but was perfect for what the place is. It doesn't pretend to be high end fine dining, but the selection of sharing starters such as nachos, ribs etc are perfect for this environment.    We started with nachos to share, we had a steak and enchiladas as main (small portion - believe me it's all you need)    We had mojitos Pre dinner and a bottle of Pinot Grigio with dinner. We finished our wine watching the cabaret show that the staff put on.    We had a really fun, enjoyable evening. The food, entertainment and ambience is pitched perfectly and our bill came to €65.    I think that's excellent value for money.",,
"Paid it a wee visit when over for a quick break..    Atmosphere excellent, fantastic entertainment, great food only downside is prices..    Grossly expensive for food and drinks, my son and I shared fajitas so in effect we had two starters and two mains between three and two desserts, two coffee, couple of soft drinks and two glasses of wine and we were 88 euro which I think is way overpriced!",,
"We went to this restaurant a number of times as it was so good. Food was great (portions were HUGE!), service faultless and entertainment was great but not intrusive. Highly recommended.",,
Massive portions - they serve absolutely everything with a side of fries and no one can ever eat everything on the table - they must throw a ton of leftovers away! Entertainment is cheesy but bearable if you only go there once.....,,
I have been to this restaurant many times in the past and as always the food was good. The steak was very well cooked.,,
"Great atmosphere,unexpected entertainment, loved it when Fat Mamma came out dancing. Loved the food,huge portions.",,
great atmosphere. great food and great entertainment. huge portions and good service. nothing to dislike,,
"We've been going to Cyprus for 8 year snow and Fat mama's for 4. We visit atleat once but sometime more. I always have the Ribs at least once. The adult size gives you 2 racks of ribs and the smaller portion is 1 rack. Both my boys love the ribs also, we've tried the fajitas, steaks and chicken and never had a bad meal.  It's our fav restraurant and well worth a visit you will not be disappointed.",,
"OMG!! My husband ate the Rib every time we where there.. witch ended up being alot!! Amazing people, on a amazing place with amazing food!! Love the different menues.. and the atmospehere they make with the cabaret, when you give a regards to the chief and so on!! Recomend it to all my friends. Best regards The wedding coupple from Norway:-)",,
"Food was great, service was slow but that was only to be expected on a busy night! Entertainment provided was a caberet show, absolutely brilliant! Will definitely come back next time we're in Paphos.",,
"Food is amazing!! We ate here several times, would recommend getting the small portions as they were plenty. We had spare ribs on the last night (small portion) and it could have fed a family of 4, they were massive. Entertainment is brilliant. If celebrating a birthday, anniversary or wedding, they come over and sing to you. We were celebrating getting married, not knowing, but my sister in law had told the waitresses, we received a mini bottle of champagne for myself and hubby and a huge congratulations from all in the restaurant. Can't fault the food, staff or location. Need one of these in the uk",,
"I am normally a traditionalist, I search out the best local cuisine and try to eat like a local. After day 2 of our holiday, enticed by queues and the wonderful cabaret, I decided to try Fat Mamma's. I am so very glad that I did. The food has been consistently excellent, mouth watering lay tasty steaks, well cooked vegetables, crist fries, wonderful staff who genuinely care and are discretely attentive. Every dish that my partner and I have tried during the last 10 visits has been well cooked, well presented and very tasty, on every visit we both struggled to choose which wonderful dish to try next. Deserts are good, starters are huge and the mains (even small portions) are large. I heartily recommend Fat Mamma's, it is not typically Cypriot, sorry other local eateries, the quality here is excellent.  Others have mentioned that the entertainment is tacky and amateurish, I disagree, the waiters make an effort and work hard to provide a varied and enjoyable entertainment every night.  All together money well spent, we will be back to Paphos in August, we will certainly return to Fat Mamma's. price, quality, service and atmosphere make this my new restaurant of choice - Thank you all :)",,
"We ate at this wonderful restaurant on 29/05/2013, there is a plenty of choice of food,waiters and waitress are friendly and helpfull made to feel very welcome, the chief is an amazing cook, would recommended",,
"We found Fat mama's by accident, and we loved it!  The food was great! The portions were generous (even the small ones) and the service was impeccable. The prices was ok. Some of the other places we ate charged twice the prices of Fat mama's and the food wasn't half as good! If you have a special occasion they will give you a surprise! Seemed like everyone there had a birthay ;P  We loved it - and if we are visiting Paphos agian we will be back for sure!    I also was impressed with the kids menu, and the fact that they brought crayons and a menu for each kid which they could color in. Then the kids had something to do while waiting for the food!",,
Went for a special birthday treatedexcellent everything was good the service and staff were excellent we would earthly go again,,
"Strange place this. From outside it would appear it was plucked from IDrive in Orlando and dropped almost next to the Tombs of the Kings. Menu is vast and very 'American' in style and portion size. Not bad value but average quality food at best. Entertainment is awful. Almost evry 15mins you are subjected to a short caberet by the waiting staff who, whilst being ok waiters, are really not singers and dancers. It was very clear that some of them did not enjoy that aspect of their job either. Not recommended!",,
"The good points: the quality of the food is fine (my partner and I ate mostly Italian style dishes). The ""small"" portions are great value at around 5 euros, and are really enough. That makes this place very good value. I can't imagine how anyone manages the ""Mama's"" portions. The service is efficient and friendly. The ""cabaret"" song and dance acts are amusing enough at first but to be honest they pale after a bit and certainly don't encourage you to linger over your food and drink. While they're going on you can't really hear yourself talk. This is not to criticise the young performers who try their hearts out, and are not without talent, but as a management policy I'm not sure it quite works.",,
The food and atmosphere is great. I have never seen so many folk have birthdays on the same night. The staff sing happy birthday and present them with a sparkling ice cream.,,
"Food and service was great, very attentive staff always close-by just encase you needed anything!  Portions are large but ideal if you like it like that.  Dancers coming out during your mean is a little tacky, but if they were good or well practiced then it would change your thinking and it would be an even better place!  Would still go back though!",,
We had heard that Fat Mamas was the place to go and even queued to get in. While the food was very acceptable with large portions we found that it was slightly overrated as it was very expensive. There was entertainment of sorts provided with three girls dancing but while they worked very hard it was clear they were quite amateurish. Would I go back there having been once? Probably not as I have satisfied my curiosity only to find there is better and cheaper to be had elsewhere.,,
The food and the atmosphere are brilliant & they always have a great ambiance from the moment you step in. Couldn't manage the 'Mammas' portions. Good luck if you try one.,,
"Although we were H/B at our hotel nearby and the food was excellent I yearned for a visit to Fat Mama's, knowing exactly what we would eat We share the potato skins, then I have a small cannelloni ( it's not that small ) hubby has a medium pizza then we share a chocolate pancake. Wonderful. The entertainment was good and we had a really nice evening. Hope it's not too long before we go back.",,
"Love the ""happy surprise birthdays"" where they take cocktails to random tables...Brilliant! Food was good & portions are huge, the ribs are amazing!! The 'cabaret' was something a bit different & kept us entertained during our meal! If we were ever to return to Paphos, we'd definitely be back!",,
"A trip to Paphos, Cyprus would not be the same without a fun and lively evening at Fat Mama's ! Plentiful food of good quality at a good price !!",,
"Just back from a great holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Went to Fat Mamas restaurant most nights because it was so good. The service is fantastic, all the waiters/waitresses are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The food is to die for and the portions are massive. The entertainment is even better than last year and all the kids loved Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy. Will definitely go again.",,
"Mixed reviews on here....... I have to say that my partner and I were very impressed, the food was very good, mobster stew and snake burger, both tasty, well cooked and quality meat, large portions despite ordering the ""small"" size. Good selection of food to match most tastes. Not typically Cypriot, it is what it is and I'm glad it is. The dancing girls who ""pop out"" every so often are classy and very well choreographed. A great experience, we will return often.",,
"met friends here on the 5th day of our holiday, but decided to go 2 days earlier in case we didn't like it, as we turned the corner the place was packed, always a good sign, most of the other places on tomb of the kings road were pretty empty, the service is so friendly, the food fantastic, cheesy dancing which was great, ended up going 3 consequtive nights, and putting on prob half a stone!! portions are huge and as it's so nice you really don't want to leave any. wish there was some in england, TGI's would close down",,
"We went early and got 10% discount for the happy hour meal deal. Have the ribs with mamas special bbq sauce to share for a starter, they won't disappoint! The chicken dish hubby had was nothing to right home about and my chilli burger was okay. All in all an okay place for a hearty meal.",,
"get there early cos the place gets busy very busy,but the food was superb and they lay on entertainment",,
"Food was amazing, service was great, entertainment while you ate was fab and kept my 1 year old entertained while we ate, will definatley be back x",,
"British visitors seem to love this place, but the appeal continues to elude me. Yes, you do get a lot of food and yes there is entertainment (though watching waitresses dancing around like amateur theatre people hurts the eyes), but for me it just wasn't good enough.",,
"Have to give this place a 5 for the fun value alone. Add to that tasty food, huge portions and friendly service and this is definitely a place to stop by. Offering two menus ... Fat Mamas which is very italian based, and Cowboy Willies which is US based there is something for everyone.    Health warning ... the portions are seriously large ... starters can easily be shared ... and the Mama sized portions will stuff even the biggest eaters. You def have to try the ribs and dont be afraid to ask for a doggie bad. Nachos. potato skins, seafood pasta all good and some fabulous desserts too.    As for the entertainment ... waiters are great ... and the team that does the spontaneous dancing have just got so much energy, which really brings the place to life, and also makes it a good place to take kids.    Yeah maybe a bit cheesy but hey its what you want when your on your hols and looking for a fun night out.",,
"Visited here last week as we enjoyed the food last August, we had a combination starter which was big enough for myself, my wife and daughter to tuck into. My wife and I followed this with a steak each both of which were perfectly cooked and virtually melted in the mouth. My daughter couldn't finish her carbonara so they packaged it up for her to bring back to the apartment.  Overall a very nice experience and good value, would visit again.",,
"Ate in Fat Mama's last night and once again the meal was superb, I had the ribs and they are most certainly the best in town. Portions are huge, well cooked and so tasty and wherever they get there meat from has to be the best butcher in Cyprus. If you are celebrating a special occasion you will recieve your own song and dance routine followed by a free cocktail with opportunities for photo's with the entertainers. For kids Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy make an appearance and once again photo's are a must. We expressed our 'compliments to the chefs' and our waiter shouted at the top of his lungs 'Compliments to the chefs from table 14' and from the kitchen came the reply 'Thank you'. All in all a fab experience but be aware...too many visits to Fat Mama's will equal a Fat Belly. lol.",,
"Although on the main Kings Road at the edge of town, the layout of the patio is good and spotless. The Staff are friendly and excellent. The food is twice the size expected. The entertainment was a wonderful surprise. Quality of food very good at a reasonable price.  Can highly recommend and yes we shouted compliments to the chef from table 33!!",,
Although this place is not on the main front at Paphos it is still such value for money. A very good choice in steaks and and other varieties of food. Caters for children and the service is second to none. If you have been before you will know what I mean. I don't want to spoil all the fun for you..We have been there e few times over the years and still find it most enjoyable..,,
Fat mamas well! I had a steak the best you've ever had with a full bag of chips practically! I couldn't move I was so stuffed. I just had to say compliments to the chef and it's so fantastic when you do... They trott off scream compliments to the chef from table 22 an the chefs shout back thank you! It's fantastic the atmosphere the dancing the music the food. You have to go take the kids the parents everyone I can't wait to visit again. Well worth every penny and that's not much!,,
"This Restaurant has always got queue's outside, the service is excellent, and the food to die for. A must if you visit Paphos. You even get entertained by the staff while you wait for your food. No good if you want to diet!!! But who wants to diet on holiday.",,
"A great eatery for the masses of food and entertainment, a place we visit everytime we visit paphos, gets very busy in the summer, but has a great atomsphere, definetely a must.",,
"Loved this restaurant, it is a must! Food was brilliant large portion s and cheap with great entertainment!!",,
a mass of good quality food very lively place with live shows - great fun-should be seen. if hungry - rack of ribs.. which is about 32 bones when done !!! :-),,
"We stayed nearby for 2 weeks, and for 10 days avoided the place as it looked too commercial - the only commercial place around. But we succumbed, and were more than pleasantly surprised. We ordered far too much, but the food was excellent, and there was entertainment provided - which the children loved, and killed a few minutes, and was a bit of a laugh, so a bit different.    So despite the commercial approach the food and atmosphere were very good.",,
"We went to Fat Mamas after recommendation and we weren't disappointed. The meal came to €35 for four of us including drinks. We went before the entertainment started and was given a discount for dining early.    The food was lovely and tasty and the portions are HUGE. I was full after a half portion of pasta, sadly no room for dessert.    Our compliments were sent to the chef, we will almost certainly be returning.",,
"We went for the show that was recommended to us, which was entertaining; so bad it was good! The kids loved it though. The portions of food were obscene in size and mostly consisted of chips. I had barbecued chicken with pineapple which was processed, salty meat covered in thick barbecue sauce - I couldn't eat it, but again, worryingly, the kids liked it! Staff were very attentive and lovely and the atmosphere was lively. Compliments to the chef were repeatedly (and loudly) called out by the waiters from various tables - maybe they had a different menu from us?",,
"Queued for a while, but well worth the wait!! Awesome atmosphere, massive portions and the friendliest staff! Will definitely go again!! Been before, missed the blonde Scouse waitress!!",,
"If you are up for plentiful low quality food, vile wine at €19 a bottle accompanied by tacky awful dancers and people in giant foam costumes then this is your place. It certainly wasnt ours. A tasteless burger topped rubbery cheese and flaked bacon (not even an actual rasher) failed to impress. it was accompanied by about 4000 chips. Never again. The staff were lovely though. Couldn't fault them. Lovely. This restaurant is like an episode of the Jeremy Kyle show. But with food and music.",,
"This place is a must!! Their food is out of this world, portion sizes are huge! Enough to feed two! Atmosphere is lovely! Great staff! Perfect for friends or families!",,
"This is really a family style restaurant and as such may warrant the rather positive reviews it gets. However, the food is just average though the portions are large. We took in the bb ribs and a spaghetti dish which was tasty but at over 40 euros for that plus one glass of wine and one bottle of water, we felt it was over priced. Staff do a bit of a floor show which the kids seemed to find entertaining.",,
"We have visited Cyprus on a number of occasions and always seem to find our way to Fat Mama's at some point. In the past it has proved to be a great night out with good food and good entertainment. This time, however, we left feeling a little disappointed with the food and the entertainment.    There is a great deal in the two menus and the portions are not for dieters! We chose from both menus and the Nachos went down very well. The potato skins on the other hand were a little undercooked and there were a couple of us left eating raw potato. The mains were fine, and the ribs were devoured in record time by my son!    The staff put on a variety of 'entertainments' for the customers during the evening. There is a musical accompaniment to any birthday or anniversary 'surprise' which goes down well, although they weren't as good as a couple of years ago. Perhaps the novelty has worn off. We then had the 'Cabaret' which again didn't seem to be as good as it has been.    To be fair to all at the establishment, it might be down to the fact that it was early season, or that I am getting too old for this type of evening entertainment! If you have never been and have a young family, then it is still worth a visit.",,
"Just visited Fat Mama's with my wife and two kids after it was recommended by someone. Where do i start? Firstly this is definitely a place which is aimed at families, everyone is really friendly and you are immediately made to feel very welcome.    I'll talk about the food and the service later but wanted to spend sometime telling you about the entertainment? it was a mix of a working mans Disney show meets Strictly Come Dancing meets Britains Got Talent.    Part one - one of the dancers gave a couple of songs ... pretty good so far.  Part two - enter Woody and Fat Mama the 'Disneyesque' character to entertain the kids (and the parents). The outfits are weren't as polished as you see in Disney, but what they lacked in refined foam features, they made up in enthusiasm and warmness. Stopping at every table for pictures.  Part three - the main act. After a Caberet style entrance complete with show feathers they moved into an eclectic mix of dance styles and the three beautiful girls were joined by two male dancers who looked more like victims than part of the show. C'mon guys ... you are dancing with beautiful girls - relax and enjoy it! That said one of them does a convincing Dancing on Ice headbanger routine - impressive!    Show over so let me tell you about the food and service. As everyone has said the portions are huge and the food great quality - couldn't fault it. The service was first class and everyone was always happy to help.    VERDICT: Food, service and atmosphere get 5 stars and i would recommend it to anyone. AND if you like a heavy dose of cheese with your meal, and not the dairy kind, you will love the entertainment. Foot tapping songs and brilliantly entertaining dancers and singers - the same time every night, seven days a week! I LOVED IT!!! Thank you to the staff and entertainers",,
"Amazing food, Amazing prices...Amazing people. Definately a must dine when in Paphos. The menu has lot's of choice and if your not a big eater the half portions are perfect although they are the size of a normal England portion (very generous)",,
lovely place to go. que evrey night best just waiting doesnt take that long burgers are huge!!!! very nice defianttly somehwere to go!!!,,
"The restaurant was very busy on the night we went, as it was most nights that we passed. The food tasted fine and was plentifull infact if i went again i would share a meal so that we could try a dessert. You get a caberet from the waiting staff that the kids loved.",,
"This place is amazing and such good value. But if you do not have a massive appetite do not have a starter. They are absolutely huge, lush, but you'll struggle with the main course.",,
staff so welcoming.place very clean.food to die for.staff entertainment so so could do with more lessons on dancing but all i all fantastic.cant wait for them to reopen in march after there winter break.been there 4 times and no complaints from myself and my partner.try it you wont be disapointed.but go for the small meal the 1st time you go unless you are a big eater then sisk the big one.enjoy folks.im more than sure you will,,
"Fun filled night out, food mostly tex mex and huge portions, fantastic entertainment and probably most quirky in Paphos",,
"Very busy,always lots of people waiting for tables.Menu nothing different .Service slow,but they were busy.will probably eat elsewhere next time",,
We travelled on an all inclusive basis but one of our friends was at a different hotel so we decided to eat out one night. Our rep recommended Fat Mama's and I was not disappointed! Our then 18 month old son also loved it. They have entertainment too. You can sit in our outside! It was just fantastic. The prices are a little expensive but then again the quality of the food is fantastic!,,
"This is one of the best holiday restaurants I've ever eaten in, and the kids loved it too. Can't wait to come back again next year.",,
If you have a big appetite you will enjoy eating here. Although not the cheapest place to eat it is very nice food.,,
"What can you say apart from ""A most enjoyable night out"". Great food, and plenty of it, Great entertainment. Great service. Busy and Fun. Kids will love it to.",,
"I was very disapointed to find Fat Mammas shut in November , but have since found out ii will be open again in March.Anyone wanting a good restuarant try The Kingfisher just up the road towards Coral Bay.",,
"Excellent, ideal for everybody, food, great portions, good service, entertainment, good value for money.",,
If you visit fat mamas try their ribs! they are huuuuuuuuugggggeeeee and to die for. It worth waiting for a table!,,
"A must visit restaurant , excellent atmosphere , great food Love it. Make sure you also check out Palm Bar, a few doors away,The bar man Tim is such a 'wonky donky' he's sure to make your day, excellent place to chill and have drinks before popping along to Fat Mamas,Once you've had a taste you'll be racing back for more................................",,
"Food was great, entertainment was superb, great fun. Not a local cuisine; either USA or italian style but done well, Great value too.",,
Famous for anyone visting Paphos. Its a lively bubbly place with a little entertainment thrown in. Celibrated our grandsons 18th birthday there. Food is plentiful and good qualiy. Lots of choice for familys (discount if you eat early). BONUS!,,
"If you have not been eating all day, this is the place to go because the food is so filling. very good food, and great entertainment. People come from all over Paphos to eat there.",,
Could get half portions as normal portions huge! Good food with lots of choice Kids loved the dancers,,
the food was so good and was reasonable priced and i would recomend this to anyone who goes to paphos ordered the ribs was huge portion wife had one of the burgers it was all so very good and as a bonus it has entertainment on as well great for the kids,,
"xxxl portions, you have been warned, if you are not a big eater go for the smaller option. The show was really good too.",,
Food was good but for the price I payed I would have wanted more. The entertanment was good at some point but I didnt like having people dancing around my table when I was eating,,
Comes so recommended but we found it pretty average with a hefty price tag. No good for anymore than 2 eating at a time because tables are too small. Nice staff though so not all bad.,,
"Very busy Haloween night, but service was still good. Food spot on with big portions, so dont over order",,
"This is not serious dining, it is a great, fun evening out with huge portions of American style grub!  I had the ribs which were the best I've had outside USA (as others have said don't go large, small will feed 1 very hungry fat man!)  The entertainment was corny, but very well done with lots of enthusiasm.  Adding in the food and the entertainment, very good value.",,
This restaurant was recommended to us and we loved it as it's lively and ideal for kids & families alike. The staff are exceptional and although the food is in abundance the quality isn't compromised which is what i expected to be honest. First class for families with kids but not ideal for a cozy meal for two.,,
"The food and service was good but I found the attactions a little bit annoying after a while, this would be a great place for a family or party to eat at but not a quiet romantic meal.    In addition, it was noticably more expensive than other tavernas we visited.",,
"If you want a great pizza or pasta, or a burger, nachos etc and can eat a lot then go to Fat Mamas.  Food is excellent, big portions and absolutely lovely staff to serve you.  Mama and Willy come out to greet you, great photo opportunity for the kids and around 9 pm there is a cabaret by the three girls and boys who also work there.  This year an excellent singer and a very 'eye candy' young man!  It really is an experience you should not miss. Visit their website for more news.",,
"Had a great meal ...Spare ribs...beautifully cooked but got greedy and went large,,,too much and couldn't finish it...Oh well,,,lesson learned for next time!! Staff work hard...one downside...The T shirts on sale there as momentos are far to expensive..about 25 euros...",,
"Fat Mama’s is well groomed restaurant, excellent service and superb entertainment. I visited Paphos for two weeks and constantly revisited this restaurant as I believe it is the best. The food is unbelievable and a variety for everyone’s taste. The portions are very big but there is a smaller option which I would recommend unless your super hungry, then the large ribs should be your choice. Entertainment is outstanding live shows every night with extras, i.e birthday dances and romantic occasions throughout the night. Dancers are very professional and the shows are well thought of, I never left unsatisfied. All staff members are ultra friendly and customer service is exceptional. This is a must see venue for Paphos, Cyprus !!!",,
"excellent place, dont go for the large portions, the small portions can feed two! staff very friendly and entertaining. well worth a visit. 5 minute walk from hotel",,
"Lovely place excellent service but they put sooooo much food on your plate!,,,My sisters meat was undercooked and brought it to their attention they kindly gave her a free meal as they deducted this off our bill as we had to wait for a fresh cooked meal",,
"Massive, massive dinners! Waiting staff who transform into caberet stars... and reasonable prices too.",,
"My husband and I ate here during a recent stay in Paphos. The restaurant has two menus that you can mix and match, one of which is Italian and the other is American. The potato skins that we had for starters were very tasty. The veggie options were a little limited, which has perhaps unfairly brought my rating down (there was little for me to chose from) and for the main meal I had a pizza with feta cheese and onions. It was nice, good sized portion but nothing special. My husband had a steak from the American menu for his main. He did enjoy it but has commented that he has had better steak and would have preferred the vegetables to be hotter.    The staff are very friendly and well presented. They also performed a couple of dance routines during our stay, it must be said that some members of staff looked more into this while some seemed to be embarrassed to be a part of it. I'm not sure that unenthusiastic dance routines to songs from Grease is quite my bag but I could see that a lot of the other diners (and the place was packed, to its credit), particularly those with kids, enjoyed the entertainment. Thankfully we weren't dining when the singer was on but had the misfortune to walk past at this point.....    Overall, portions were decent sizes and reasonably priced, just a bit lacking on quality and variety.",,
"you need to get to this place early or will have too wait to get in.we booked but you can only book upto 7 o'clock, but once your in there's no need to rush. food top notch and entertainment quite entertaining..oh! and when you pay tell them to compliment the chef..",,
"Biggest portions I've ever had, too much for any of the 8 adults in our party. Entertainment too which was unexpected and great.",,
"Nothing to dislike, staff very friendly and helpful, food good and entertainment was fun. Definately a place to visit if going to Paphos. It was good fun and we visited the restaurant twice in the 11 nights we stayed",,
Really good atmosphere lots of singing and dancing ( I know. It's a restaurant ) the portions are large so go when you are really hungry . Good value fir money and a really enjoyable night,,
"Food is amazing, very large portions so be careful what you order ! Staff are friendly and service is great, enternainment is great.",,
made very welcome grandaughters birthday staff put on dance and sang to her she was 6 .whole family enjoyed the food which you can have in 2 size portions,,
"great food, lovely staff and good we bit of entertainment as you eat. must go try. decor nice and looks very clean.",,
"The food is really well cooked and there is plenty of it, the staff are always helpful, especially when deciding what and how much to eat, my advice is skip the starters because unless you have an appetite like and elephant you can never hope to eat all the main course. Rack of ribs is a whole chest of sheep!!! Anyway the staff do a little act and dance, especially if there is a birthday in the paying guests.",,
This is a brilliant fun restaurant and the portions are enormous! Service was great and food very tasty. Every so often the waiting staff appear in costume and do a song & dance act to celebrate somebody's birthday. Definitely a place to visit if you are in Paphos,,
"We have visited Paphos about 15 times now and on our recent visit after much hesitation we gave into the idea of trying Fat Mama's, always a queue outside throughout the summer, good reviews so we had quite high expectations.    No Queue in October, quickly seated & given the menu choice (italian / american) Wine price although choice was good and ""limited"" to imports mostly. However we were here to eat, enjoy the ""well renowned entertainment""    The Nacho's Shared starter was rather hot & spicy and adequate as a sharer, then the main of ""Grandma's Yeehaw Chicken & Hunters Chicken"" were simply a cut breast of chicken caked in BBQ Sauce, with 75% of the plate covered in chips to make the portion adequate enough to charge the similarily high prices.    One of the waiting staff seemed very disinterested, the entertainment was cheesy / cat strangling bad & the cabaret a hash of little songs with uninterested male dancers joining in occasionally to make it a little different. Infact the only ""clapping or cheering"" came from fellow staff members rather than any other of the tables of paying guests.    We feel they could do ALOT better, the reputation is somewhat ""coloured"" as even some local friends had only heard good things about it. We certainly will not be ""enthused"" with another table here, more local entertainment without the high prices is otherwise available, more enjoyable and with service that cannot be faulted.    Mama may be fat, but using the slang term it wasn't quite ""PHAT"" enough to get us to return.",,
Wouldnt say the food was as highly rated as everyone makes out. If you like being entertained by its a knockout charactes who cant sing then you will love this place. Food not worth the money. Wouldnt go back.,,
We have been to Fat Mama's a few times over the years and have always enjoyed our meal. It's quite quirky and something a bit different.,,
Spent an evening here recently. It is really a place for families with young children. The service was very good and efficient. Beware the portions are huge !!!!,,
"Loved the atmosphere, loved the food. Best ribs have ever had in my life and have ate at some amazing restaurants. Went here twice and both times was great, staff were lovely and helpful too. Go there if you get chance.",,
"While on holiday in Paphos we spent a really enjoyable evening at Fat Mam's. The food is good and the portions large, so maybe take that into account when thinking of starters or deserts. The staff are very friendly and put on a good show while you eat. The prices aren't bad and the whole experience makes for a great night out. Having been to Cyprus on a few occasions I can whole heatedly recommend this restaurant.",,
"a lot of the restaurants in Paphos seem very impersonal and that they dont seem to care about repeat customer.  Fat Mama's seemed to care about making an impression and having people come back. prices were a little more than some places but worth it.  entertaining night and the food was some of the best we had. the servers were friendly, a little americanised but in a good way.  close to the harbour but not really walking distance in the day time. but on a very busy street for food and drink. very nice place, if we were to go to Pafos again we would return without a doubt.",,
"One of my favorite restaurants eat at we want one in Glasgow ! Entertainment was brilliant staff were friendly, food was AMAZING no complains Thanks",,
"Can't understand what the fuss is about, it's just a second-rate American burger bar trying too hard. If you've ever been to Hard Rock Cafe this will disappoint.",,
We visited Fat Mamas one night for a meal and considering there was 24 of us the bill only came to 20 euros each which was a bargain considering the size. They entertain you while you eat as they put on a show and if its a special occasion you get a special song just for you.,,
"monster ribs but staff struggled to serve a group of 26 people,good entertainment, slightly over priced",,
Food is great and plentiful - staff singing and dancing is a bonus and if its a Birthday you get a sing song from them all and a cocktail which is a good laugh. A definite must if you visit Phafos.,,
Been a regular visited for years but Mama seems to have lost her sparkle. I had overcooked ribs and my wife had an ok pizza. Staff seemed bored and the little shows we're lame. Very poor vocals ! You need to up your game guys.,,
"The place is two merged restaurants: Fat Mama's is Italian and the other is a barbecue place - with a name I have forgotten. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious. I had the regular, but they have an extra spicy (which I tasted but did not like as much). It was delicious. They had a cabaret show- nothing special, but, it was free. They sell hand painted glasses which are beautiful. Service was fast and fun.",,
"The food here was great, but too much. I could not have a desert because the starter and main were just too big, great value 17 of us went one night and all had starter and main with various drinks all for 400 Euro",,
"We went to Fat Mama's as we were recommended it by our holiday rep. The staff are very outgoing and put on various performances throughout the evening. The restaurant provides a mix of American and Italian food and you can mix and match the menu to suit. However the staff tend to perform the same routines each night, so you may not want to visit at the same time each time you eat there. Cowboy Willy and Fat Mama characters come out at around 8pm and the kids love to have their photo taken with them.",,
"Having visited Fat Mamas many times over the years, I was looking forward to another treat. However, it was so disappointing and in stark contrast to previous visits. Our waiter was rude, clearly wasn't too fussed about serving us and when he did, it seemed to be a huge effort. Despite lots of empty tables, we were made to wait, this gives the impression to passers by that the place is busy. The quality of the food has also suffered and I think the microwaves must be working overtime. I fear for the future of Fat Mamas unless previous standards are rediscovered.",,
"Ate here twice, first night and last night of our holidays. Had looked at the reviews before we visited Paphos and Fat Mama's certainly lived up to what others had said. Food, staff and entertainment (dancers) were very enjoyable. We always ate a bit later at night 8.30pm-9pm. Any earlier and you had to queue to get a table.",,
"We went here as it was near to where we were holidaying and it came recommended.    The food and portions were as everyone described - large. The food was of a decent standard and what you would expect of this type of restaurant.    The dining experience is not for those with small children or if you want to talk whilst eating. It was loud, over-the-top and dominated the evening which is not really what you expect when you go out to eat.    This is a personal taste issue and if it is the type of thing you like then Fat Mama's is a good choice for food but it was not for us unfortunately.",,
fantastic place you need to book as it is very popular food is fantastic and good value make sure you are hungary,,
"If you are looking for lively entertainment whilst dining out in Paphos, Fat Mama's is the place to go. Great food however the large portions can be slightly off-putting.",,
"Been to fat mamas before and enjoyed it (6 yrs ago). Definitely not as good this time though. Portions of food huge so you don't need a starter so no complaints there. However, thought the entertainment was annoying after the 2nd time and the waiter service was rubbish. My wife asked for a bottle of water which came back warm which she sent back and they still put it on the bill! Nice try. Then when our food came it was thrown down on the table. Food nice enough but drinks, especially water a rip off. Wouldn't go back again but ok for kids.",,
"We wish we had seen the portion sizes before ordering as I wouldn't have got a starter which was garlic bread but when it came it was 6 slices (this was only one portion). My other half has a big appetite but even he struggled with the Chilli & rice he ordered, entertainment was good too",,
This place is fantastic and the entertainment amazing. The food portions are massive. The staff must be shattered with all the singing and dancing they do. A must if you are celebrating a special ocassion xxxxx,,
"Busy restaurant serving a variety of food, has dancers and singers providing entertainment! Has characters coming out which our kids found amusing!",,
the taste of the food and the portions alos the service is very good and it has a bit of entertainment too,,
"Food was spot on and loads of it, great service and entertainment, lots of other places in Tom of kings",,
The food is fantastic and portions are large and these were normal plates. You can get a cowboy plate which is XL but this is for those with a huge appitite as the normal size was more than enough and I like my food.  The ribs and burgers are amazing and the ribs are a MUST!!!!!!  The downside for me was that the large tables were all left set up for 6/8/10 seats rather than broken down to seat more smaller groups so people are left queuing downside waiting which was unnecessary I feel if these tables had been split up.  Singers come and do a song once every 15 mins at the front of the restaurant which is great the first 2 times but after that its too much and if you are sitting at the front (we were in the back luckily) you are disturbed by this and cannot be seen or served by staff during the performance for 3-4 mins.  Food was great though so if the entertain is your thing it's a definate must.,,
"Sorry for the delay with review but I can tell you this resturant is great. I took my wedding party of 18 here the night before my wedding and the food to start was great and there was so much of it :-) the entertainment was great and really appreciate the personal touch mention and performance wishing us the best for our wedding, just wish we could relive it all again",,
"When visiting Pathos Fat Mamas is a must, advise to book, or your have to queue outside for a long time! Steaks were cooked to prefection. Entertainment from the waiters and a guest appearance from Fat Mama her self makes it a truely memorable evening,",,
"Expensive for the food although they serve large portions fahitas, burgers and steaks nothing traditional- but an entertaining visit.",,
"Visited here for dinner last week, food was good and portions big and atmosphere was spot on! Would recommend.",,
"We tried to eat here in June, encouraged by the fact that people always semed to be queuing to get in, so we reasoned it must have something worth queuing for...  Well, the evening we went sure enough there were people queuing but on closer inspection the place was half empty. Hmm, strange....  There were also lots of staff milling around too but no one approached us in this ( seemingly manufactured) queue for a good ten minutes. In the meantime the group in front of us got fed up of being kept waiting for no obvious reason and walked off. A waitress eventually came over to us and when we asked for a table for three she then told us to wait a minute and disappeared off again, this in a half empty resaurant! By now we were cheesed off too and chose to take our business elsewhere.  If the idea of getting people to queue (needlessly) is to make the place look popular and and drum up more business then it is backfiring spectacularly .",,
"We took our 3 youngest, who are all at Uni, to Paphos for a last 'family' holiday early September. On their last night there (we stayed an extra week) they wanted to go out to a fun restaurant and we had seen Fat Mama's from the road so decided to go there as it looked lively for them. Firstly, we had to queue and my husband hates queing for anything but particularly food! We dont understand the reason as there were plenty of vacant tables. The waiters and waitresses entertain the guests by doing song and dance routines while serving. Some of them could not sing a note and they sounded like strangled cats. The service was poor, and the food was even worse. The final insult was the bill as it was the most expensive meal we had out in Paphos. In short, we would NEVER go back to this restaurant again.",,
We visited this restaurant 6 times during our holiday and each time the food was delicious with generous portions. The service was prompt and friendly. Great atmosphere with good quality entertainment throughout the evening. Entertaining and professional dance routines and an excellent singer made all our evenings enjoyable.  We would recommend that you visit this restaurant if you are in Paphos. Don't be put off by the queues. It's worth the wait.,,
You so have to get here if you like ribs. We had them and they were the BEST I have ever tasted. Meals come in 2 different sizes and we were glad we only chose the normal size. They were big and very very well cooked.    There is entertainment in the guise of singers who do different cabaret songs. We were glad we were inside rather than on the front near the entrance so did not get disturbed every 15 mins when this happened.    So worth a visit and easy to get to on the bus going to Coral Bay from the Harbour.,,
"this restaurant had people queuing to get in so we thought it was worth a visit.well,we felt like we was seated feed and that they couldnt wait to get the next customer in.the food was pretty basic,a choice of two menus but really didnt think that food was anything special.they had the staff do a show which was average.may suit people with children but not for us.sorry fat mammas very disappointed.",,
excellent ribs and steaks. staff worked hard and acted as the entertainment too.my son and wife to be were seranaded to the tune of going to the chapel[much to there suprise] and given free champagne. other guests celebrating birhtdays etc were treated in the same way,,
"the choice on the menu is big, two kinds of food , staff are really good,loads to choose from i loved the ribs, the entertainment is all so great",,
"Well worth a visit to Fat Mama's, food amazing an entertainment as the evening goes by. It does get busy so if there's a big group book. Ribs big portion are massive but all good amazing from there Jemsk1",,
"the food was excellent and to say the shows that they put on were the staff they were very good quality, definately somewhere to try, be warned though, only order the small portions unless you have a huge appetite :-)",,
We went 4 times during our holiday and every visit was superb.It was very busy and we had to queue for about 5 minutes but it was well worth it. Plenty to choose from the menus (Italian and American) and the food was brought out very quick.The portiions are enormous so no need for a starter. Even half portions were a struggle to get through. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the entertainment was an added bonus. The dancers were very energetic and looked as though they were really enjoying themselves.  Would thoroughly recommend you visit Fat Mammas,,
The portion sizes are too big but that's not a complaint!! Husband had rack of ribs don't go large!! The entertainment is fab a bit cheesy but it makes you smile. Always a queue to get in but you don't wait long for a table,,
"I have been here 3 times and food is very average. Only interested in singing and shouting compliments to the chef!!! Not on this occasion!!! Salad and coleslaw were not fresh. When I questioned quality of meal with one of the more senior waiters he just looked at me!!!! In short not value for money, they disguise poor quality of food by cabaret",,
"Need to go! Had a great time.Massive portions. Entertainment is great - dancing,singing and you get to meet Fat Mama herself!",,
"Wish I could give this restaurant less than 1 out of 5! I had a poor visit to this restaurant a few years ago but decided to give it another go just last week. It was even worse than I remembered it to be; we (table for 2) waited for a table for 10 minutes, even though we could see over 10 tables available. We were seated just before the 'cabaret' started and it was the most cringeworthy thing I have ever witnessed. Customers were also given death stares by staff as they moved around the restaurant during the 'show'. Ignoring the 'entertainment', we looked to our menus - we had starters which arrived promptly and were fab, but it all went downhill from there. Our main courses were awful, with relatively small portions, and my friend had a pasta dish wish wasnt cooked fully. I ate about half my meal, and my friend barely ate a thing. When we had finished, a staff member approached our table and said 'did you not like your meal?', to which my friend replied 'no'. The staff member then said 'i didn't think so...' and proceeded to lift our plates and disappear. Next time we saw him, he was pestering a couple of British girls at a table across the restaurant. He never came back to address our complaint. It took a further 45 minutes to grab attention of a staff member to ask for our bill. We were not offered our bill or anything after our disappointing meal. We gave up waiting, paid our full bill and left. Both working in the hospitality industry, I was embarrassed to take my friend to this place. I'll never be back again.",,
"what can i say ,we went with friends and had a great nite the staff are very funny and the food was great",,
"Portions massive, staff excelllent and attentive, well worth the visit. Cowboy portion of ribs works out at 3 complete rack of ribs, a real belly buster. Also Lasagne was massive for mormal portion.",,
Checked the menu out small portions or cowboy portions me and wife decided to order just two mains massive portions really tasty food and well presented. Polite and helpful staff and some entertainment came on which we didnt expect great night. Just would have preferred to have this restaurant in centre of Paphos,,
"The kids all seemed to enjoy the little shows the staff were putting on throughout the evening. We went as a family of 4 and all ordered different meals, chicken, ribs, king prawns, a steak and they were all really good.    The portions were huge, the staff were cheerful, the restuarant and the atmosphere were great.    WE went here Aug/2011, hadn't booked, had to wait at least half an hour for a table, expected I suppose in high season.",,
"Yes.... we had to queue, for about 15 minutes but it was worth the wait. The food, service and entertainment was fantastic and worth the extra money it costs to eat here. Go, eat, relax, watch and enjoy!",,
"we went to fat mamas with some friends we met on hoilday as they said it was good the last time they went so we all went just for a change from the hotel as we went all inclusive. easy to get there on a bus. we had to queue to get in but only about 10 mins the tables were a bit small for 4 people but still possible to eat your dinner without bumping in to each other. lots of choice on two different menus, starters were of normal size but the main course was nice and big me and my husband had the burgers they were big juicy and fresh are friends had the steak wraps and they were so big they could not eat it all one was enough for two people i think. the service was very fast and the entertainment was very good well worth a visit. will go again next time we are in cyprus",,
nice restaurant but expected better food. staff was good and the food was fast. price was high other restaurants had a better price for the same food. entertaiment was great. the waiting for a table was not good if the choice where mine i would go somewhere else.,,
"Two menu's offered American and Italian, don't know why it's not just on one but there you go.    I ordered small carbonara as a starter (that was massive and I couldn't eat it all - left most of the pasta after picking all the bacon etc out)    Pepper fillet steak (small portion again) asked not to have the potato or veg brought as knew I wouldn't be able to eat it despite it coming as part of the meal. My steak more than filled me as I struggled to finish it off.    Would I go back again. HELL YEAH!!!!",,
"We ate in this restaurant 4 times during our stay in Paphos! Everything about this place is fantastic. The extensive menus provide a huge choice for all tastes. The food is delicious and served on time by very cheerful and efficient staff. The entertainers are first class, the three dancers put in so much energy and enthusiasm into the routines and really make you feel special if you have an occasion to celebrate. Fat mama and cowboy willy are also great, both providing family fun for all ages.  The restaurant has a great team spirit and it is clear that the staff all get along and have fun whilst working to provide a top quality service. We can not recommend this restaurant enough, go and enjoy- just make sure your hungry the portions are very large!",,
"If you are going here to celebrate a birthday ? it is the best entertainment with all the guys dancing also you have a fantastic birthday night with a sparkler in your cocktail. Our waiter was called Roberto, he may have been new since only January but he looked after us so well.",,
"We visited as a family of four, and found the choice (American & Italian menus) very extensive. The service was excellent, and the ad hoc entertainment amusing. The food arrived quickly, and the portions are generous, to say the least. Would recomend it for families.",,
"It was excellent value for money, portions are large, so dont eat throught the day.  We had to queue for about 15mins but it was well worth the wait, waiters & waitresses every now and then give a song, which was great.  We were out for a romantic meal and it certainly was as the waiter was in no rush to get us out and get the next customers in.  EXCELLENT PLACE",,
Only went to Fat Mama's once as there was always queues to get in. Food excellent and the portions were large. Don't go here if you want a snack go when your hungry.,,
"Well what a great little find, this restaurant is not for the faint hearted, ensure u are starving before going. If anything the portions a too big, u do have the option on many meals to opt for a 1/2 portion, i would recomend this unless u have a huge appetite. Food quality was  great, service faultless and general abience of the place buzzing. This place was always busy when we passes, it puts on entertainment and caters for children woih a play area. Saying that place is big enough for couples not to be bother by children and enjoy a quality heart meal, highly recomend a visit, try the ribs, amazballs!!!",,
"Went to this restaurant after meeting some friends from the UK who were staying at a hotel close by. Not sure what to expect but we had a terrific night. Staff were friendly and pleasant, choice of food was unbelievable- really to much as I had a job to decide what to have. There was an American Menu and an Italian Menu. Choice of large or small portion on many dishes, so plenty to cater for all tastes. Even the fussiest person should be able to find something suitable from the great range. Food was hot and tasty. We did find the drinks a little pricey. The entertainment which was unexpected was good and the girls and lads worked very hard. We shall be going back even though it is about an hours drive from where we live.",,
"Well worth visiting. Great food and very generous. Great service and entertainment. Oh, tell your Waiter to relay your thoughts about your meal to the Chef. You'll love the way they pass on your message.",,
"Still very good value, good choice of menu and very tasty.  Went twice had a burger first time and the cowboys portion of ribs the second time, very foolish my eyes were bigger than my belly and i couldn't finish them. Never had room for pudding and the drinks a little overpriced but in total a good night out.",,
"this place is fun and you're kids will want to keep coming back, the food is fine and service good, it's the shows whilst you eat that make the place",,
"The food at fat mama,s was really good,choice of two menus which you could pick and choose from,the service was quick,and they had dancers every night who were very good,we liked it so much we ate there twice.",,
Great food and massive portions! Food to suit everyone! I had fajitas and other memebers in the group had the ribs which looked amazing.,,
"Visited Fat Mama's on a recommendation.    Food ok but not the best restaurant we have visited on our trip    Reasonably priced 150 euro for a family of 6 adults including a couple of visits to the cocktail bar    Staff provide a small stage show in between serving, very cheesy. If you think x-factor that would just about sum up the singing/acting.    Give it a go but don't go with any great expectation.",,
"Was recommended Fat Mamas by a friend and loved it. Went 3 times during our fortnight. Does get busy so try to get there before 7 (you get 10% discount then too). Food was lovely, 2 menus American and Italian. Good sized portions, the most enormous children's chicken nugget meal I've seen! Good quality food and good service. Had one of the best pasta sauces I've ever tasted. Prices were ok...certainly cheaper than other restaurants i'd say mid-range budget. The entertainment was great fun and made for a great atmosphere. Recommended!!!",,
"A must-try place during your Paphos stay. Food was excellent, and speedily served even when extremely busy",,
"this place will never change, been coming here for quite a number of years and still cant get through the whole menu. the food is excellent, the staff and service is out of this world.",,
"Good food and entertainment, having to wait for a table was annoying. We had lovely steaks and the staff were amazing.",,
"Yeap, this was an excellent choice. Trip advisor is ranking this restaurant in Top10 and thought of trying it. Great fun, good fun. A gem is discovered !!",,
"Very busy and noisy although good food - typical ""American"" style restaurant that also serves Italian food.",,
i enjoyed my meal here and loved the show but thought it was a bit on the expensive side my bill was 104 euros for 3 people,,
"If you have ever eaten at TGi's this is very similar style menu etc... Very good family restaurant although expensive around €80 for a family of 4. Staff perform dances to music which keeps the kids entertained, portions are big and adequate. Very busy at peak times around 20:00hrs and you may well have to wait, they do an early bird offer 10% off before 19:00hrs. Depending on table location can be a little crowded and hot but staff friendly and helpful and witnessed some parties asking to be moved.",,
Food was good - large portions Entertainment was also good and lively. On main bus route. Staff were friendly and congratulated our friends on their wedding the next day with free dessert!,,
After 6 years of visiting this restaurant. Last year were average and this year I thought I'd return. I wish I spent my money elsewhere. Very rude staff. Slow service. It is sad to see what used to be a very good restaurant make me feel like this. I'm not the type of guy to complain about stuff like this but I felt I had to write a review. I will never be coming back here again.,,
"We come to Cyprus every year and have always loved Fat Mamas but last night the food was awful. €16 for steak that was thinner than my iPhone and burnt with some sauce definatley not peppercorn sauce. Children's pasta spicy , extra sauces charges €2 for.  Asked for seabass well done it came soggy and undercooked.entertainment was poor.  I can't sing but could have done better and dancers not in time with each other. Asked for drinks at end of meal 15mins later no drinks but the bill!! It used to be very good it's a shame it's gone downhill. We won't be returning.",,
"Fat Mamas is situated on Tomb of the Kings Road in Paphos and is packed every night of the week. There is a regular bus service running from Coral Bay via tonb of the kings road to the harbour and back (1Euro each way).  The food is always very good with a very large choice and not rip off prices. No need to order starters because the mains are huge, but if you do have one to share.    The staff give a show every night and cater for children and adults so it's a really good night out.    Don't worry if you see a queue outside you will normally get a table very quickly",,
"To say this is only a restaurant is an understatement. A nightly ongoing show of singing and dancing waiters makes it much more than that. All of this led by Cathy wife of the owner, who makes everyone very welcome.  The food is very varied, and of a good standard, and as you can guess by the name of the restaurant, the portions are very large. I would suggest you get there early as at times queues to enter become the order of the day. If you have to queue I think you will find it worthwhile.",,
We went to see why there were queues every evening ! Food was good with large portions - the entertainment fun (surely they can't have that many birthdays per night !) - but the bill a bit heavy !,,
"Having visited Fat Mamas twice last year, when the food, service and atmosphere was excellent, so i expected the same this year but was left very disappointed the food was average the singing and dancing was very poor with no atmosphere at just not worth the effort, the service was extremely fast and sometimes the staff were unhelpful and rude hasten to add i will not be returning next year, nor recommending it to any more family and friends !!!",,
Excellent service. They do great burgers - probably one of the best I've had. Combination of Italian and american mid-west food (they have 2 seprate menus). Cheesy but good entertainment all evening with the waitresses coming out to do a little song and dance routine regularly. There were several birthday celebrated there - and the staff make it special for them.  Good desserts - large portions. I would definitely visit this place again.,,
"Just a bit of fun.... why they make you queue up outside is beyond me... lots of tables empty, big queue... is it reverse psychology? Food average",,
"Entertainment all evening, and great variety of food and very generous portions, you can also order a Fat MUMA portion which is absolutely huge.",,
"have to queue if its later in the evening but the food makes it worthwhile, very tasty lots of choice and very reasonably priced.",,
"Food was okay, not brilliant, was expecting more as had read the reviews about it. Odd singing and dancing every so often. Drinks expensive and food average. You can opt for larger portions but you dont really need to, standard was big enough.",,
We had a couple of goes on the go karting track then two families descended on Fat Mamas. I read the reviews and pretty much concur with them all. I would go again if returning to Cypres as the food was very plentiful and well presented and having the singing and dancing half way through was certainly a bonus. (Watching the acts frantically changing costumes behind a hastily rigged tent on the street outside was also entertaining :)),,
Amazing atmosphere...huge portions! the starter was big enough for me and then the main which i had as a small portion could have fed two people, great value for money :),
"Had found the website online before holiday as heard a lot in reviews and my 7 year old decided she just had to have her birthday tea there. The food was ok and something for everyone but the entertainers definitely make it. Had a word with the main hostess and after they finished a energetic routine all came and sung happy birthday to my daughter, presenting her with a sparkler in a ""cocktail"". She was over the moon, they really made her day!",,
"It really is. So much going on. So many staff. And such good food.  2 menus to choose from so you won't be stuck for choice.  If you're going as a family there's plenty on offer, fat mama and cowboy willy make an appearance. Singing and dancing to entertain everyone.  Always busy so go early, or be willing to que, but honesty it's worth th wait.  Personal opinion, get the fajitas!!",,
"If you like TGI Fridays you will like this place. The entertainers were very random, which made it entertaining. The cowboys portions were huge and no human being should be able to eat one to themselves so be prepared for a doggy bag, or just share.",,
"We had a short queue to get into this restaurant which is on the busy Tomb of the Kings strip. To get the most out of the staff entertainment sit in the central area, but we were quite happy to sit in a nice outside area.    The menu had a wide range of American / Italian fare. The portions were large and tasty. Staff were polite and helpful but kept rotating so the visit did not feel very personal to us, certainly compared to the service of traditional Cypriot restaurants.",,
Didn't actually get in because there was a queue and it was far to warm to stand and queue. Went across the road to O'Neils Irish pub bar and had a great steak and chips.,,
"Fat Mama's is a themed restaurant which is very popular with the tourists as the nightly queues for tables will testify to. The food is just OK, the portions are large, so be warned and have a real good look at the drinks prices, because they can really bump up your bill. We were a party of five (4 adults and 1 child). We knew the meals were large, so the adults shared two main courses, the child in our party had a plain burger and there was one dessert. With two bottles of wine, three beers and two cokes the bill was €115! They have tried to cater for the smaller appetite with half portions. There is intermittent cabaret and singing from the waiting staff throughout the evening, but it is not as good as it used to be, however the kids love it when Fat Mama and Cowboy Willy make a visit to the tables. All in all not the best dining experience, but as a one off it is  OK, providing you can afford it. There is a discount for dining before 7pm.",,
"We drove by this place a couple of times and marvelled that a single restaurant could be responsible for such an impressive queue which spilled well onto the pavement. As a group of five, we're still wondering.  The portions were huge, but this is really overpriced fast food washed down with overpriced drinks.  Service was painfully slow because there were simply just not enough staff and when the food arrived, we looked at the queue that was still building, and will forever wonder. Why???  One final note, every twenty minutes or so, staff that were previously waiting tables picked up a microphone and we endured several minutes of cheesy cabaret as they danced around the tables. The very young children found this quite endearing, and it was so bad it was almost good!",,
The food at fat mamas was lovely our party of for all in enjoyed our meals. The entertainment was an added extra that made the place bait different and the kids enjoyed it. The only thing I would say is get there early (before 6pm) as its extremely busy unless you don't mind to que but people aren't in a hurry to leave. It was reasonable priced to.,,
"wow this restaurant had queues from about 7.30 onwards the food is excellent but very big portions , lively place and extremely popular",,
Excellent food and entertainment. Accommodated 21 people with no fuss at all. Very fast service aswell,,
"Good food, but a bit on the pricey side. Watch the soft drinks as they can add a bit to your bill. Always a popular one, get there early or expect a long queue to get in.",,
"we enjoyed our visit to FM's. I did notice that as we were eating, we were constantly being asked if we wanted more drinks, when the bill came I realised why- food was about 60 euros and drinks 40, wouldn't mind so much but this was for 2 adults and 2 kids and weren't even tipsy when we left.!  anyway that aside the staff and atmsophere are great, food was good and we enjoyed the visit.",,
"Good food, a little entertainment and great service. Fajitas expensive so I suggest you share and ask for more Tortillas.",,
It is only open for the holiday season and is closed from around October through to Easter. Outdoor and under cover seating. No need to make reservations just turn up and hope there is not a Q. They have an early discount if you dine before 6 or 7pm (need to check). The menu has something for everyone and the ribs are fab. Slightly pricier than similar venues but woth doing it once if you are over on a holiday.,,
"food here was OK, but i cannot believe that people actually queue to get in here. its supposed to be a sort of american rib type place, but if you're expecting wonderful food you will be disappointed..... its ok, nothing more. the 'entertainment' is just slight annoying/ weird if you dont have kids with you!",,
"Fat Mama's food was any average steak restaurant food. But the food was good, the portions were huge and the atmosphere was good. They had tattoos, face painting, and nail painting for the kids and shows that came on about every five minutes. Over all it was average.",,
Fabulous entertainment and service. The children will love the entertainment! Huge portions so make sure you are hungry! Good value for money too!,,
We had heard so much about this place and had high hopes but unfortunatley it wasnt that great.    The menu is probably a bit too extensive and Im not sure they can cope with the amount of dishes they have on offer.    I had Steak Rossini which sadly was cold and my husband had Veal which he loved. The kids had Pizza and Ribs. The pizza was like cardboard and cold as were the ribs.    The restaurant was very busy but thats no excuse for cold food. The waiting staff put you off your meal as they were literally running about like lunatics trying to deal with customers,,
"Interesting!  2 menus, Italian & ""meat"" (i.e. steaks)  Huge portions (adult size ribs would be a challenge)!  Good service.  Staff shows put on around you (Grease, Brittany Spears etc)  Get there before 7 for a 10% discount.  Get there after 7 expect to queue for a table.  Nails and temporary tattoos on site to keep the younger girls entertained.",,
Very lively and busy restaurant with food which i would rate as ok for adults but great for kids. Live music delivered by the staff!,,
"you cant go to paphos and not experience Fat Mamas - great food and lots of it, excellent entertainment",,
"This restaurant is one of the busiest on Tomb of the Kings road - and it should be. Massive platefuls of well cooked food, good service, plenty of choice, cheesy entertainment. The only thing preventing a 5 rating is the management of the queue to be seated. There seems to be a desire to make sure there are always a few people waiting at the entrance, despite there being tables available. But is it worth a few minutes' wait? Absolutely! Go and eat, but make sure to have a very small lunch beforehand!",,
"Great place, very popular, can be a queue but it soon goes. Good food and the portions are very pleasing. Great staff - very friendly and helpful. Good atmosphere - like the entertainment. Good prices. Well worth a visit.",,
"Very popular restaurant, queues every night, but when you visit you see why. Plenty of food to choose from and good entertainment. Definitely worth every penny.",,
"Below average food which was bland, queuing is deceptive as people are made to wait when tables are available to make themselves appear more popular. Tacky dance routines and poor menu particularly for vegetarians. Better local restaurants nearby which appear less attractive on the outside but serve tastier and fresh food. Try metaxas nearby first side road on the right with supermarket opposite, had a lovely meal with good service and value for money.",,
"Very nice place, super busy during dinner time. The food is mix of italian and american. The service is very nice. During the season they do some shows in the evening.",,
"We went as it was recommended by our rep and was a waste of money!!!!!!tacky , stodgy food and half hearted entertainment, a terrible choice of a night out!!! Please note, coming from an Italian background I know both how Italian food SHOULD be cooked and what is acceptable regarding such, and the cheese they used on my pizza was repulsive, reminiscent of melted cheese strings!!! Do NOT go here unless u intend on eating chips at about €5 a pop!!",,
"I really enjoyed the sizzling Beef Fajitas, plenty of beef, peppers and onions served on a hot plate, the only downside was the wraps were tiny, they should be a lot bigger or serve 5 of that size, i was left with loads on the sizzler and i had ran out of wraps.....but it was tasty!",,
"Found we had to que to go in but the restaurant was only a quarter full. The service was ok, nothing special. Food ok , but thought it took a long time between starters and main course, what it should have been, so nothing special to comment on. Disappointed on the whole, wouldn't go back. Certainly would not again to get in.",,
"We had read great reviews about Fat Mamma's and decided to book for the Sunday evening. We were told the latest we could book for was 7.30pm, so accepted that even though we had wanted to eat later. I had prawn cocktail, which was nice, though small, my daughter had cheese/garlic bread. Her starter was very greasy and actually too much cheese to be enjoyable. I had a fish dish to follow which said 'served with fresh vegetables and a choice of jacket or chips'. The fish was in a tarragon sauce and was quite nice but nothing special. The vegetables were a very small portion of brocolli, about a dessert spoonful of sweetcorn and some plain boiled rice - as well as my chips. My daughter's pizza was like a cheap supermarket type basic cheese and tomato variety. We didn't bother with desserts as if the other courses were anything to go by, it wouldn't have been worth it. By 7.30pm there was a long queue for tables and we were very glad we hadn't wasted our time that way and were at least able to be out of there by 8.30pm and spend the evening elsewhere. I think this place suffers from offering both an 'Italian' and an 'American' menu. It would be better sticking to one type of cuisine and doing it better. In comparison, we ate at 'Duomo' Italian restaurant on the last evening of our stay in Paphos - which was cheaper, more authentic and a much more pleasant experience altogether",,
"We go to fat mama's every visit and untill now have not been dissapointed, the food was nice, some of the staff are nice, they make people wait ouside even when there are tables free (this i have been told is to make it look more popular when there are ques??) when the staff did the entertainment/ singing dancing it was done very half hartedly dont think they really wanted to be there infact towards the end of our meal neither did we!! only pluss side is you will never go hungry thier meals are large.",,
"went,ate,left feeling like a fat [--].....    always noticed the ques for tables, we thought no chance are we queuing theres plenty of other places to go, but by chance on night we passed and the que wasnt there, so we went in, and we can see why theres ques,,,great food",,
"Food was very good and even the normal portions were huge. Nice to have a bit entertainment with your food. All the staff do a fab job, the must be exhausted at the end of the evening. Compliments to all the staff from Table 11.",,
"My family ate here last night, when we first arrived in the taxi and seen the queue outside we thought this looks promising........and we weren't disappointed, we only queued for about 15 mins before we were seated. It took awhile to get our drinks order and to order our food but the place was absolutely full so that was a bit understandable. My partner and I both ordered steaks( which were cooked perfectly) and our children ordered a small rack of ribs and a pizza, I tried both of these and they were very tasty. The small rack of ribs was absolutely huge!!!!  All the portions here are massive so I would advise not to get too adventurous.  A starter for us all to share,the meals mentioned above and 2 beers, 2 wine and 4 cokes cost us €82 which isn't bat at all......plus you get the entertainment thrown in for free  Nothing more to say apart from...ENJOY!!!!!!",,
Good food and good entertainment - good fun. Like the fact they sing to you if its your birthday and the dancing is fun to watch,,
"Went twice - ordered Chicken wings and potato skins to start and then the BBQ burger and Pizzas as mains - quality of the food is fantastic especially the burgers! Big portion sizes but I ate it all it was so delicious!  Not too expensive, loads of choice and staff are friendly and welcoming. Entertainment if it's your birthday but I wont spoil the surprise!  Desserts - massive chocolate cake! Yum!",,
"We ate here and the waiter and waitresses not only served quickly in a packed restaurant, but the sang and danced too! My 6 & 10 year old boys loved it and the food was your standard something and chips. Good value.",,
Serves very English food to an average standard. I like to experience local restaurants and different food and culture when I am abroad and do not want to eat typically English food (we ate there as we were hungry and it was close). Entertainment makes you cringe.,,
This restaurant is lovely for food everything that everyone in our party ordered was delicious and portions where very generous. Defo worth a visit for a meal if you are out in paphos.,,
suggested we go by friends who had been before and they were right the food was excellent the atmosphere great and the staff very efficient a very good night out well worth a visit hope to go back next year.,,
We visited fat mama last night and it was a great experiece. Both the adults and the kids loved it.  The food was very good and the ribs was amazing! Only disapoiting was that they dont have cola zero and the sodas was very expensive. The rest was superb.,,
In 2011 and earlier it was brilliant but now in 2012 it has gone down hill dramatically and they do not seem to be bothered.    Lots of tables are empty but they make you wait at the gate creating the impression they are popular.    The food was similar to that in a transport cafe and despite asking four different servers to do something about it nothing happened.    The drinks are also approx double that charged by other restaurants.    It has been the same owners for quite a few years but they appear to have lost interest this year.,,
Go to Fat Mamas the atmosphere was great the food was really good & I dont want to spoil it for you but the service was a real surprise you will love it,,
"this resturant was excellent, food fantastic, very big portions and good live entertinment. the staff were very friendly, and if you were celebrating a special occasion they brought you out a cake with sparklers on it and sang to you",,
"You don't go to Fat Mamas for the food - it's the whole ""experience"". The wait is a pain, especially as there were loads of free tables, and they seated people at a glacial pace. I did wonder whether this is to ensure it always looks busy and so keep the buzz about it going. The choice of food is huge - American or Italian, so there is bound to be something to please everyone. The food itself is plentiful (too big in the case of the children's pasta) and is ok - not great, but fine. My steak was way overcooked, as I'd asked for it blue, but my daughters was fine. It's definitely a place for the kids - my two loved it, but that may have been more for the tattoo/nail service that was offered on the side. Not somewhere to rave about, but definitely worth a visit just to see what all the fuss is about.",,
"Great food and atmosphere but the waiter on our table was rude when I questioned if I had the correct meal. Will go back though, good overall.",,
"The food is casual and not bad at all. The children especially enjoyed the food, but also I did too . The problem is that is not only on hte main, big road but also full of loud families who are there mostly because it is not too expensive.It gets very busy indeed and the tables are very close ot each other so that you get pushed constantly by all the children..",,
Worth a visit. Always very full. Superb steaks and massive portions. Reasonable price. Liked the snippets of entertainment.,,
"The food is so nice we had to eat the same meals again the week after. We said we wouldn't return because of the poor staff service but we had to with the nice food.    The tables were full so we had to wait 10 minutes for a table. No problem with this. We got told we could wait in the tiny bar area at the back, fine. We got told we could get a drink while we wait, fine. We asked for a drink, we got told by the bar man wait 5 seconds and he will be with us. Did he hell! we waited 5 minutes for a drink and he still didn't seem interested in serving us. They had 1 barman on the Friday night, ridiculous. Need more staff who work! Not just stand around doodling all night looking like their doing something but they are not!!!! Too lazy!!!  We never got a drink, the lady came over and said our table was ready by the time the man even bothered to serve us. We ordered a drink at the table but then no drinks arrived for about 10 minutes. The service was poor. Slow. Once we had ordered drinks and were waiting another waiter came over, didn't even make eye contact, was looking down at his pad of paper and just said ""do you want to order"". We replied ""do we want to order what?"" and he said ""your food"". We said ""no, we have not even had our drinks yet. A drink would be nice"". It was bad. It is such a shame because the food is amazing! They are so under staffed its a joke and if they focused on kicking the staff they have up the bottom to do work and even pretend to want to work there and be friendly, it might be OK. Expensive but the small plates they offer are big enough for a female. The bigger plates are worth it for the male customers.    They do this Fat Mama's 10 minutes little show they put on for you, great fun to watch! very slightly different every night i guess but it is still repetitive if you want to return. It was a good idea to do this and it obviously brings people in. It is always packed there and a good restaurant for food but if the staff focused on serving and being polite and wanting to be there, instead of doing a show and prancing about, then the place might be ran a little better.",,
great staff and great choice of food. all well cooked and huge portions.,,
"Whether you want burgers, ribs and steak or Itialian pasta, this is the place, but get there early as there is always a queue after 19:30. You also need to look out for the short shows performed by some of the staff during the evening. All this makes for a great night.",,
"The only reason I have given Fat Mama's an average score is because of the entertainment, otherwise it would have got a Poor!    The entertainment is great, especially for the youngsters in our group and even the big kids! It makes a fun night out from that point of view and the décor is great. However the food is awful, they really need to focus on quality instead of quantity, they give huge portions of bland, tasteless food. I'm not a food snob at all, but when I'm on holiday I like to eat nice food, this is an American diner type place and the food lacks taste and flavour. The service wasn't great, mainly all English staff but they just seemed uninterested and it was hard to get a hold of one of them to get another drink or anything, then when we finally did we waited ages for it to arrive.    We went in June 2012, we were a party of 6 adults, 2 small children we had 2 sharing starters between us and each had a main meal, the children 2 kids potions and 1 adult dessert it was around 160 euros. We had much nicer meals including Greek food at other places in the harbour and at the very nice Greek restaurant next door.",,
"You can choose from two different menus as they serve Italian food and American food. We were 7 people so we eat from both menus and they were yiummi!!!!! Also they provide a very good entertainment as every 10 minutes, 5 girls come out and make a small show with singing and dancing.",,
"This is a popular restaurant on the Paphos/Coral Bay road and is a great place to go with the family, young or old (as long as they are young at heart).  It is alongside and seems to share facilities and menu with Willy's Rib Ranch, although there is distinct Italian and American offerings. The music is loud and during your meal it is likely that Fat Mama and Willy will put in an appearance fully kitted out in their costumes, the kids (big and small) love the opportunity for a photo session.  As an aside the fod is good also, I had a steak and the menu had a set of pictures of cooked steaks that allowed you to show the waiter exactly the colour you wanted, mine was spot on and so really enjoyable.  As introduced, lively and fun, not exactly the choice for a romantic meal for two but worth a visit.",,
"The food here is bland and tasteless. Don't get me wrong I love nachos, fajhitas, burgers etc but even these simple straight forward dishes seemed beyond the chef's capabilities. The chilli in the nachos was tasteless (have you heard of seasoning?) and was served with a big dollop of sour cream but no salsa or guacamole. I had the fajhitas for a main course and the portion was huge (as are all Fat Mama's portions) but they only give you 3 flour tortillas to fill, meaning you still had half your fajhitas left and no tortillas! Extra tortillas can be purchased at 40p a throw, but seriously, just give us enough to start with and drop the fries that come as extra. Who ever heard of fajhitas served with fries??? My hubby ordered beef enchiladas as a main which turned out not to be beef but to be the same bland chilli that was used on the nachos....yuk! He ordered the small portion but once again it was unecessarily OTT big! The amount of food that must go to waste here on a nightly basis is shameful. Get a grip Fat Mama's and start focusing on the quality of your food and less on the quantity.    Just a quick note on service - we did complain about the ""Beef"" enchiladas and it was removed from the bill without any hassle and the waiting staff were efficient and nice enough.",,
"firstly guests are left queing outside the restaurant when there are plenty of tables free inside and staff stood around (this is to make it look busy for passing travellers) not a good way to make a first impression when you are left waiting 10-15 minutes outside on the street. we sat down and when the waiter came to take our order, he asked if we wanted starters. we said no as we didnt, he then insisted we did as the restaurant was very full (another way of pointing out how 'busy' it was) and the food may be a while. For such a big restaurant it should be able to serve food in a reasonable time especially as it wasnt full. so reluctantly we ordered some garlic bread the second time he 'pressured' us into it. the steaks come in two sizes, fat mamas size which stated the weight, and a smaller weight, for which it didnt state a size. i asked the waiter what size/weight 'small' was as i didnt think i could eat the large. he laughed , stumbled and said, umm smaller. the waiter could speak good English he just didnt know the weight, which is pretty poor. When the waiter came to take the empty plate from the garlic bread he said, are you ready for your steaks? We thought our order was already in the que, so why did they ask? within 5-10 minutes after the steaks were served, not the 30 minutes the waiter who ensured we had a starter had previously said. We ordered the larger steak as we had no idea how big the smaller ones were, and low and behold could not eat it all after having a starter. Just a way to get more money out of guests. we didnt leave a tip.",,
Not the greatest food but that's not why you would go. Its just a fun experience and worth a try.,,
"brilliant staff., best ribs ever, 30 of us went to eat not 1 complaint, we have been to paphos 5 times and never had a problem in fat mamas, kids love it, portion sizes are way way waay big",,
"Great atmosphere with fantastic great value food. The portions are enormous, the lasagne comes in casserole dish !!. The staff also put on a bit of show during the meal",,
"I guess this place is ok if you aren't really into food or if you have young kids as there is entertainment or if you like chips but my boyfriend and myself found the food bland and generic and it just felt mass produced. People actually queued to eat at this restaurant and I honestly don't know why. Do not order the pizzas here, you get amazing pizzas - traditionally made in a wood oven at Martellis down the road. Do no get Mexican here, there is an amazing Mexican restaurant a couple of minutes down the road from here (to the right, near the Pitstop bar). I had a pasta dish, it was tiny. My boyfriend's pizza had no flavour. We saw someone get ribs which looked ok but not enough to tempt us back another time. If you like good food then don't go here.",,
"The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced - you have a choice of 2 different menus so you have a great variety of choice. The singing and dancing waiters and waitresses make this place a great night out for friends/family. And all the costume changes / popular show songs performed are such good fun to watch. We didn't realize that the restaurant doesn't take bookings so if you don't get there early then like us, you might be queuing down the road for a while to get in but it's worth it!",,
Go here the night before your wedding if getting married the meals are great and they make such a fuss out of you. Book early if in a large group,,
We didn't get good service. We had a post wedding party of 24people they sat us in two tables every1said you have to go there I don't think I would go bk,,
"We went to this restaurant on my husbands birthday, 01/07/12 there was just a small que to get in but this was well worth the wait, the service was second to none and the entertainment was a pleasent suprise, the prices were fair for the overrall experience.",,
"Visited two weeks ago. Food is average, chips and coleslaw wasn't the best. Ribs nice. Mussels were lovely. It's the entertainment that makes this place different. It's very expensive for what you get. Tip:order the half sized portion. It's still generous and half the price.",,
"Went to this restaurant once during our two week stay. The portions where very good and prices where ok, there is cheaper in paphos, the restaurant had large ques outside every night which I didn't really get? We went between 5-7pm when you get 10% off. Food was nice but nothing special, desert was by far the best part of the meal.  Drinks where expensive and it must be the only restaurant in Cyprus that dosent sell keo!!",,
great big meals and a great atmosphere too a good variety of food over 2 menus,,
"We visited here twice in a week, food top notch, great portions, the large portions of ribs is massive but also tastes great. We were a little surprised to see singers and dancers come down the middle of the restaurant singing and dancing, it was a change I suppose, but if you prefer a quiet dinner it's not for you, but kids love it so highly recommended for familys, as norm for paphos a little pricey.",,
Had to try here after reading the reviews .Had to wait ten minutes which I did not mind but found it strange when I could see 3 empty tables.  Sevice was very good.I think I was expecting thefood to be something amazing but what I got was good.  We shared a portion of ribs to start which was nice For main I had a chicken dish and hubby had beef stew and for desert we shared Cherry pancake which was lovely glad we had one between us because it was huge.  It was the most expensive meal out we out and had better meals elsewhere at a better price.  Did enjoy it but prob would not go again,,
"What is the fuss about ! I must be missing something , the food was good but the waiters were very pushy and the entertainment was really cringy! I think it wasn't cheap either ! 4 euros for a pnt and 11 euros for a pizza. But the atmosphere was nice as it was so busy, def would not go back",,
I would highly recommend a visit to Fat Mama's the food is excellent! I had one of the burgers easy one of the best I've had! Portions are big and the cost is reasonable. All the staff are friendly and the do little singing and dancing show by the entrance from time to time. Great atmosphere you would be silly to give it a miss if your in the area!,,
"The restaurant is split into two and is also known as Willys Rib Ranch. You will always find a queue outside this place giving the impression that it's full. A good trick to draw in punters but it's not the case if you get there around 8pm ish!  The food is good and there's plenty of it although a little pricy for what it is. You get a huge choice of Italian or ribs n burgers.  The large size burgers are enormous but the Itailian food is reasonably sized, well a normal portion.  Nice night out with some light entertainment from the staff, especially if it's your birthday, four the night we went!",,
"Fantastic night out, massive portions great value for money, staff are really friendly and helpful, never had an empty glass!! Sat chatting then random  Entertainment would come happen, staff singing and dancing, full on routines lol would definatly go back next time we are in Cyprus",,
"This place was always busy - large queues outside to get in so we were always envious that we couldn't get in - well that was until England played football while we were out there in June 2012!!    Portion sizes are huge even the 1/2 portion sizes and t.b.h good value for money, so go there hungry! Yes the entertainment is a little cheesy but hey it's the staff doing it and they do a pretty decent show - so good on them!    The staff are all friendly and mostly English and after talking to a few they work damn hard so please appreciate them when you go.",,
nice place for food very busy good entertainment bit pricey but all round good selection on menu.,,
"Over-priced, limited and unremarkable food.  Ribs, burgers, pasta, etc.  It's like a low rent Frankie & Benny's, but with some added cheesy dancing staff action. It does offer something different from the local & increasingly common chinese cuisine though, plus the kids will probably enjoy it.  Go early (if you must), or be prepared to wait in a queue for a table.",,
"We stayed across the road from Fat Mama's, we went twice over our holiday. First time we both ate from Fat Mama's menu (you get 2 menu's one italian and one american ranch type food), I had a half portion but it really was very small. Also for 2 of us with just a main and one drink each was 50 Euros. Second time we went we ate from Cowboy Willy's menu, I had a small portion of ribs, and boy were they big. Much better value for money, and they were delicous. So I would definitely recommend a visit there, the 'show' was interesting, good for a laugh, if you are feeling hungry though go for the american menu. Have a great time :)",,
"We stayed in hotel on b&b basis and glad we did unless we would not have found this great restaurant.  One of the best steaks I have ever had, came with chips and baked beans, different, all staff were great, they aslo put on a show each night.  So good went their 4 times over 10 day period.",,
"There is always a queue outside Fat Mamas and you can see why. . . . they provide entertainment for children, family friendly, great cocktails and serving food other than the usual mezzo and steak selections you get in most restaurants and taverns up and down the Island. I find that a lot of the places cater especially for the English palate, which is great at time, but then leaves most places quite limited in choice. Fat Mamas was different, the service was great and the menu (American / italian) was vast. The prawns with garlic sauce (off the italian menu) and fajitas (off the american menu) were some of the best i have tasted in a long long time, and i eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants in London. The portions were good and the waiters knew the menu well. We also had the ribs and whilst there fell of the bone and were extremely succulent, i felt that the sauce was a little sickly sweet, so when given the option to go standard or spicy, perhaps do a mix of the two?  I would say that this place is mainly for families and friends, though you can go as a couple (the cocktails are fab), it isn't what i would call a romantic restaurant per say.",,
"Really good place to eat, excellent food and service! When I asked the waiter if the cheese cake came with ice cream his response was "" If you want it to come with icecream it comes with ice cream!"" really excellent !",,
Fantastc food and entertainment. A must visit restaurant if visiting Paphos!,,
"Fat Mamas is a long standing restaurant which is split into an Italian and American themed venue. Fat Mama's has lots of pasta dishes (very tasty!) and Willy's Rib Shack has the American staples including back ribs etc. Both themes are housed in the same restaurant area as one.    I passed the restaurant a number of times early evening and noticed queues to enter (not a long wait though) and it got my interest as no other places were in such demand. Finally chose to check it out, and had a great experience.    Staff double up as entertainers, and they carry out various brief but entertaining shows through the evening. At 21:00 they do a bigger show which was again really entertaining, and these elements do add to the fun atmosphere and a glance around the place showed many happy faces.    I had my 6 and 8 year olds with me, and they were extremely well catered for, and the staff kept popping by when time permitted to interact with the kids and have fun. They soon won over the shy pair, and even played trumps with them which was well received.    Food was excellent, but as mentioned in other reviews the portion sizes were reasonably big. A starter and main would most definitely fill you up, maybe even beat you.    I would thoroughly recommend this place, and I am sure you will have fun and good food should you choose to visit.",,
"2nd time back in cyprus fat mamas was def a must and did not regret it we took family and friends and they all enjoyed it we went back for a 3rd time and once again was not dissapointed we had a little bottle of champagne from them as we just got married which was a nice touch,the meals are HUGH but atleast you dont walk out hungry,def recommend to anyone superb place ;-)",,
This is a great place for a family gathering however it can get very busy with quite a line waiting to get in,,
Visited here a couple of times. The portions are huge and were of a good standard. The restaurant is always busy and the entertainment is good especially for young children.,,
"Lovely place, great food, we ordered american style food, back ribs and stake. portions are large and everything is tasty. stuff is nice, helpfull, they double up as singers, dancers. very nice place, with good prices. If you want to go to Fat Mamas don't leave you place when you are hungry, as because they do not accept reservations, the restaurant is always full so you might have to wait 23-30-50 minutes.",,
"Went twice and both times had a lovely meal and great entertainment don,t visit Paphos without visiting this place it's great .",,
"I think people rate this highly because of the party atmosphere created by the entertaining dancers who double up as waitresses but as for the food - the fish made my husband ill, I could not eat the lasagne as it was just a mush of tasteless white sauce - the plates were taken away without questioning why the meals wre hardly touched. Not one to make rash judgements, we tried them a second time - different choice of food gave a better result but still not good enough for us to return for a third try.",,
"had a lovely meal here very big portions and the staff entertain you while you eat, pizzas are lovely as is the pasta can also get American style food.",,
"Went to Fat Mama's after seeming it heaving with people and reading reviews on here.    As people state brilliant night ;) when we got there people were being sing to as it was their birthdays! We had a visit from willy rib shack and fat mama which was funny! The foods a big if you order mama portions! And there was a show which was on at 9 which was good!    Also do not forget to say ""complements to the chef!"" after you have finished your main course!  X",,
My visit here was like an episode of the TV program Man vs Food.  The mountain of bbq ribs I was presented with for my main course was enormous.  For those of us with a healthy appetite this is the place to go.  On this occasion MAN WON!!!,,
"Excellent place: the food, service and entertainment are brilliant. Have visited numerous times with friends & family and they have all love the place.",,
Loved this place..the food ..the staff and entertainment.... the young lad that served us was really friendly and turns out he lived just a few miles from us in Somerset..small world.!!,,
Good food staff great and entertaining pizzas really good value take advantage of there discount eat between 12 & 7,,
"Booked our holiday and was talking to friends about it all excited - one suggested we must try 'Fat Mama's! - It's not a name you forget! So after a short car journey we arrived!    I was looking forward to my meal as we had heard good things from friends about their time here so was full of anticipation! Fat Mama's you didnt let us or yourselves down!    I had starter, main and desert! Entertainment was good kids were entertained which was good enough for us.Bit more pricey as to what we would normally pay but it was very nice food so we didnt mind at all.    Quick tip - get there early this place gets filled up - and fast!    Enjoy",,
"FatMamas is a must when in Paphos.It does good quality food . Very nice steaks , ribs that never seem to end covered in fantastic sauce. The choice from 2 different menus gives a wide choice of food. I've eaten here several times over the past 4 years and it is consistently good. My only dissapointment this time was both the canneloni and lasagne, both seemed to be the same and lacked pasta with too much white sauce. As part of a group of 10 we tried lots of different items on our last couple of trips. The other pastas were good. The meat comes in the choice of normal or large sizes. It's always tender, cooked as ordered and a challenge to finish.  The food is not the only good thing. The staff entertain with little shows of singing and dancing done to a great standard. In all my visits I have never had a complaint about the staff. Very friendly nothing is too much trouble.  Let them know if you have a special occassion and they will make it memorable. We had a birthday, engagement and newly weds celebrated on our last holiday. 10 out of 10 of us loved the place. Even our 21month old grandaughter loved it so that makes it 11 out of 11.  It really is a great fun place with good food. Don't miss out on it.",,
"The service is always excellent, but the food is not so great... I've been there two times and both of the times been disappointed of the taste of the food. Maybe i expect too much because in the high season they are always full. They have a queue outside and people don't mind waiting outside to be seated, although it's about 45 degrees outside and the humidity is more that 90%. But the atmosphere is worth having a not so delicious food. And ofcourse a bottle of a nice local wine makes everything better :)",,
"Great for families with young children as they have a resident fat mama and cowboy george who have photo's taken with the kids. Nice food, althouggh very large portions. Best not to have starter the first you visit as you wont be able to finish yoyr lovely main course. They also have shows during every evening of the waitresses/waiters who perform popular shows during the evening and also sing for celebrations. Not cheap but very nice.  There is always a cheque to get in!!",,
"This really is a fun venue when you're in a group with some youngsters ( 6 to 15 age group)  We have been there a lot in the past but the desire to go now the youngsters have grown up and dispersed I was worried would wane but it really hasn't, we go once or twice whenever we go to Paphos and really enjoy our visit the food is very nice the portions huge and the cheesy shows just get better.",,
"This restaurant is certainly a find in Paphos. Located on the Kings Road at the Tomb of the Kings, this eatery is a must for all holiday makers to Cyprus. The food is good, well proportioned and the service is excellent. This has always been a staff ant for those with massive appetites, although of late the menu does cater for half portions which must reduce the wastage when food is left. I do like this restaurant and will visit on a regular basis, if only to watch the staff making fools of themselves with 'holiday camp' entertainment! Don't get me wrong, this all part of the charm and I can almost but garrantee a good night had by all.",,
"We really enjoyed this restaurant - great portions of good quality food at sensible prices. They have entertainment on too, people singing and dancing and mascots that come out as well - great entertainment for kids. We never waited to get in like some reviews on here say, seated straight away, order took quickly and the food arrived both times in probably 15 minutes - great for when you're starving! One of the best places we ate in Cyprus, would definitely visit again. (discount too from 5-7.30pm!)",,
Not something special. we went as some friends recommended this place. portions are huge just because the plate is full of chips!!,,
"Entertainment good, singin and dancing! Champagne for my and my new husband when mentions that we had recently it married and a cocktail for my grandad and happy birthday sung to him by staff. Wonderful atmosphere, staff were attentive and very helpful. Would return tomorrow!",,
"I thought that this restaurant would be a bit over the top but really enjoyed the experience. Good food, great staff, a good night out.",,
The menu is extensive and the food excellent. When the music starts the waitresses start dancing!! The staff are lovely. Prices very reasonable. Bre-book or arrive early to avoid disapointment!!,,
"This restaurant has something for everyone !    Great food , excellent service , great value for money , good portions , good varirety ( 2 menus ! ) , entertainment with a difference and friendly and helpful staff !    Don't understand why people are complaining about having to que to get in ? Surely that is a sign of a good restaurant ? To avoid the que you will have to book in advance. Can book for the same day though.    A special mention to DJ who was helpful , attentive and charming.    Will be returning on my next visit",,
"The portions are massive, quite hard to finish but that's no bad thing! The portions are very good for the price, and food is delicious.  However, having to queue for ages was not great so if you're looking for a quiet restaurant not the place! If you don't mind queuing though, it's fantastic :-)",,
"Great food, huge quantities, reasonable price, lovely staff and a bit of amusement thrown in as well.",,
"Would highly recommend eating at Fat Mamas. The staff are great, very friendly and entertaining. The waitresses put on a show every evening with singing and dancing. The food was reasonably priced and the portions were HUGE!! I'd challenge anyone to finish the Lasagne, it's massive.",,
Me and my family have been there 4 times in the two times we have been to Cyprus an we all agree that it was the best place we had ever eaten at but we also think that the portions are a bit on the big side but apart from that amazing,,
"Food was lovely and very filling, atmosphere was good, clean and well maintained. The staff were friendly and very efficient. Only down side was the mini cabaret in the middle of our meal. Not being a big fan of cabaret as it is, it wasn't the best, and the smoke machines they had for effect left us choking mid meal. Karl Pilkington would have a field day! Would go again if I was in the area but would request a table in the corner/around the edge away from the mini show, so we can enjoy our meal.",,
We passed Fat Mama's many times on TOTK's road and we finally decided to go in. And we're glad we did. You get handed 2 menus...one that has mostly italian food and the other full of tex mex food. We got seated very quickly and our orders were taken quickly too. Just after the drinks arrived...the music was turned up and some of the waitresses appeared in fancy dress and started to sing and dance in the middle of the restaurant.  This was usually to wish someone a happy birthday or anniversary but good entertainment.  Then the food came and you get great big portions...we thought it would be good to shre some ribs for a starter but the portion we got could of been your main course!! It was huge! Then our main courses came and the portions were just as big. All the food was well cooked and very yummy.  The prices weren't too bad and if you dine before half 7 (If i remember) they were offering a percentage off your bill. The restaurant does get busy later on but it is a very nice plce to eat,,
Very filling definatly go there again Loved it The only dislike is that they have very big portions,,
"Great place to eat. We have eaten there a few times and the food and entertainment was fantastic. If you want to eat there be early or you will have to queue, but it is well worth the wait.",,
"Staff were super and the menu looked great. The food was average but the portions were so huge (especially for kids) that it put us off our food. Fun place for kids and quite busy even at the end of the season, lots of staff and things going on.",,
"We went to Fat Mamas for a family meal, the service was brill very friendly staff the entertainment was great for the kids. Food was beautiful. The only negative (which isn't a big thing) is the portions were too big and it was a little to theme like for my taste however great for a fun night out all in all good",,
We had read on trip advisor to go here and ended up going twice. The food was excellent and lots of it (11.5 ounce steaks) The staff were friendly and attentive whilst in-between service sang live songs and preformed a show. For the kids watch out for Fat Mama !!,,
We ate at this restaurant twice during our stay in paphos after having it recommended. We were not disappointed. The food was really great - we have huge appetites and struggled to finish. The nachos were the nicest we have eaten anywhere. What really made the night special was the singing and entertainment - we really enjoyed it and will definitely return.,,
"to start, been reading all these reviews before i made a comment. And my review was going to be very simple and just recommend but after reading these reviews and narrow minded people saying the que is to make the restaurant look popular where as you can see its popular from the inside not from the que on the outside. Be realistic if there wasnt a queing policy and everyone sat themselves down, there would be no way to keep track of who came in first therefore service would fail. The que is there for a reason... To ensure you get quality food and service. Do you really think the chefs can cook hundreds of peoples food at the one time. The entertainment is brilliant there not professional they are simply waiters and waitress' who get involved to make your night that little bit more enjoyable and different! 6 days out of my 7 day holiday i went to fat mamas and got to know the staff.... We found out that every member of staff has there own alicated jobs so you all try take orders in that busy restaurant, dance, take orders , dance. ALL NIGHT. So a restaurant that probably covers 250 people when full so 350+ a night and to get 1 or 2 narrowminded complain in a blue moon, that there chips tasted like mcdonalds chips, get a grip.... a chips a chip.",,
"Food was good, entertainment whilst eating was ok, if your not up for stuffing yourself only order the standard steaks the large are massive!",,
On arrival fat mamas was packed there was singers and dancing the food was good as was the portions . The food was maybe a little expensive not much but it was well worth it give it a try .,,
We went here the food was really good. The staff were fab any excuse to break out in song. Great for everyone including kids. There's a show about 9.30 every evening which is really entertaining you can see the staff love their jobs. Would definately recommend a visit.,,
"We did manage to go twice this year and we have worked out the menu to suit us. The first time we shared the potato skins, then I had a small canneloni ( do not be fooled by the word small, I'm a big eater and there is plenty) and hubby had the medium pizza, then we share the chocolate pan cake and didn't leave anything. We do see people leave such alot of food. 2nd visit we skipped the starter, hubby had the canneloni and I had penne pasta(both small) then we had a dessert each, hubby ice-cream and I had the banana split which was a little disappointing, but on the whole both meals were very good.",,
if you are going to visit fat mama's go before 7pm and get 10% off your bill. try the the ribs they are brill and plenty of them,,
"Brillant place to go, extremely good value for your money, i only had the small sized meal and that was plenty for me, the Large plates were defenaitly LARGE!!!!. The waiters and waitresess turned into entertainers through your meal which was also very good. It really is a place you have to visit even if your all inclusive. The bus ride from our hotel was only 2 euros return and they run quite late into the evening.",,
"Great place, great people, great food, great entertainment! I love this restaurant, very much recommended!",,
We went to Fat Mama's on a family recommendation & it was fabulous. Not only was the entertainment amazing the food was wonderful too. The menu is very extensive there's something for everybody.The staff we're all great & really friendly.    If you're in Paphis it really is a must-especially if you have children for them to meet Fat Mama & Cowboy Willy!,,
"excellent service great food your entertained ,the staff first class.full menu itsthat good we had to make another visit just love the atmosphere",,
This place is always rammed and has a queue out of the door. There is no set menu and so is more expensive than a lot of other restuarants but the portions are so big that the small portions are still very filling. We ate there twice it was so good and is great for kids as they have a cabaret act.,,
"We have been going to Cyprus for many years and have eaten by Fat Mamas on many occassions. We have always found the staff to be excellent, the entertainment is brilliant for children and the food is always very good. Yes you might get a lot of fries, but to be honest if you took the fries off the plate, you would still be full after eating everything else, and there is always an option to swap the fries for a jacket potato which I have done on many occassions. At the front of the restaurant you can get tatoos, nail painting, face painting etc. which is again brilliant :)",,
Went twice - both times excellent service and food. Went early (5-7pm) as there are queues to get in afterwards because it is so good. Helpful and friendly staff and a great range of fod to suit all types.,,
"The portions were HUGE!!! The food was lovely, we were served quickly and the food came out quickly too!    Myself and my partner shared nachos to start they were so yummy but too much as by the time our mains came we were half stuffed!!    I had hunters chicken which was lovely, one of our friends had ribs which they said was lovely and the portion probably would have fed all 6 of us!!    This was good value for money as we paid £25 a head and each had starter,main and alcohol, we had no room left for desert lol!    I would definitely advise this restaurant! You won't be disappointed!!!",,
"Food was great, portions size was outta control, but loved it!!! The staff were so nice and great singers!",,
the best ribs and the best food with great staff and great price what more do you need loved it thank you,,
"Huge portions, the ribs were superb, the atmosphere is lively and friendly, the staff work their backsides off.I mentioned it was the daughters birthday and during the meal three young girls came singing and dancing over tto the table with a free cocktail for her, very nice of them.  We asked for none smoking and had to wait a short while for a table, if you are happy to sit next to smokers you will probably get sat down sooner, it should be noted that non smoking and smoking are seperated by an invisble line, we refused the first table we were offered because it was next to a table of 4 diners blowing smoke all over the place, it never ceases to amaze me that smokers are either so addicted or so ignorant that they cannot last the duration of a meal without lighting up.",,
Terrible cooking is attempted to be covered up by wastefully huge portions which I can't believe fools anyone. Sent my carbonara back as it was inedible. Also they make everyone queue so it looks like a popular place when there are tons of free tables. Don't fall for it! Spend your holiday money somewhere authentic instead.,,
"This restaurant was reccomended to us by people we'd met at the hotel we were staying at - I wish we'd been tipped off about the very. very weak spirits that were served..... because if we had drunk lager all night this review would have been very different...  The food was excellent, the seervice freiendly and efficiant and the cabaret shows every half hour great fun....... but the drinks??    Bacardi and lemonade with zero lemonade.... and even when challenged the drinks were practically alcohol free !",,
We came 3 times on this holiday and every year we come to Paphos we visit. The food and athmosphere is Fantastic. Everyone who travels to Paphos MUST go to Fat Mamas,,
"sorry to say we went here after seeing the Que. and thinking it must be good, WRONG, the only reason people are standing outside is because the staff are slow to seat anyone, There were at least 10 tables free when we were in there, Its a ploy to make u think the place is so popular, Food was nasty, mushrooms to start tasted like they were a year old, Steak tasted like liver, micro veg and loads of chips I think they got from macdonalds, Hubby did say the ribs were ok, The so called entertainment was poor, Have been to Cyprus 5 times and this was the worst meal we have ever had, 3 drinks 3 starters and 3 main meals, 1 being a childs meal and drink was over 80 euros, Do not be fooled by this place from the outside and save your money.",,
"After seeing the queues for this place I was very intrigued to try it!    The service and food was ok. Quite pricey considering what you got. But they did do 10% off everything (food and drink) before 7 which was a good offer.    Very loud if you have any oldies with you! But I quite liked it. Couldn't do it every night (would be too big and deaf if I did!)    Worth a visit if there is no queue. But plenty of great places to eat nearby. Good business model, proven by the numbers going in and the lack of people in neighbouring restaurants.",,
"Fat Mamma's is possibly the most popular family restaurant in Paphos judging by the queue to get in. The staff are great, very attentive and the place is very lively, with the sporadic bursts of entertainment. The food is plentiful, portions are massive. It isn't The Ivy though and don't expect it to be. It is mass market food for high numbers of people on any night, but it is fine. I would say if you like Franky and Benny's then it is of that ilk. It is the atmosphere that makes it so popular, and the staff.",,
"Having read the mixed reviews and seen the long queues I decided to give this place a go. Seriously, I do not understand what is going on here. It was by far the worst meal we had during our holiday. I started by ordering chicken wings. At £7.50 for a starter portion of chicken wings, I was not expecting a plate of very small deep fried wings that were hard and tasteless. The main burger was ok though nothing better than I would expect in a very average beefeater. My Partner had a margarita pizza which she said was tasteless. The entertainment was in my opinion, shocking!!! If you have been to New York and experienced the true entertaining waitress's and waiters in cafes / restaurants, you will be very disappointed.    After our visit, it became a running joke about the poor people that were queuing every night.    This is only my opinion on this restaurant but I certainly will not be returning and I think after this season, the restaurant will struggle to survive, I cannot believe for a moment that there will be much return trade.",,
"We had heard mixed reviews about this restaurant so decided to give it a try and we were so pleased we did. Despite having to queue to get in, we waited about 20 mins for a table, and was met with a really friendly waitress. Not the place to go for a quiet meal, it is a loud restaurant with lots of entertainment and we were there in August so every 15 mins a few of the staff do a cabaret act. You can mix & match the menu and order different size meals. Our food was huge, the rack of ribs filled a silver platter and my garlic mushroom starter was the best I had over 3 weeks in Cyprus. Id recommend this restaurant for an entertaining evening not to be forgotten. One of a kind.",,
Visited fat mammas twice in a week and it would have been more but we werent prepared to wait in the queue...The food is out of this world and portion sizes were massive bit the price was low so it was a winner takes all!!!Gorgeous food and the staff even do thereown show!!If you get the chance to go dont miss it!,,
"fat mamas will be the one restaurant everyone tells you to visit in paphos, the queues to get in prove that this is a popular restaurant with tourists. I unfortunately cant understand why. Very expensive for low quality food, poor choice and average service. I would strongly recommend the more traditional restaurants on tomb of the kings road (dias zeuss, farmhouse tavern, tea for two) as you will receive much better service and much nicer food.",,
great family atmosphere food outstanding too staff great !!,,
"We were reccomended this resturant by family who live in cyprus and were only told to expect a suprise. There are two menus to chose of so loads of choice. the staff were amaising, we found them very attentive and friendly. They were very enthusiastic and this created an upbeat feel to the atmosphere , then to our suprise our waitress and joined another couple of staff and ""performed"" a dance ( dont worry you will not be asked to joinin)  We loved the concept and would love to bring it to the uk. We chatted to waiting staff ( yes we had a few) and they told us they work 7 nights aweek, the cheifs all live together and some of the staff share accomodation. He said they HAD to all be friends as they spent so much time together and this showed, and they seemed to really enjoy thier jobs- I do not agree that you cannot combine waiting on tables and performing- the staff do a fantasic job of both. We went with four adults, two teens and two children of 7 and 3 all of us were entertained all evening.  The food was also excellent and very very large.  let them know if its your birthday or special occaosion!",,
"Was recomended by our Thomson rep as being a good family night out and he was right.  Get there before 8 to avoid a lengthy queue  Service was very good; attentive without overdoing it  Food was good, not amazing, but the portions were massive...perhaps TOO big as it made us feel guilty for leaving some  The show was fun, and the interludes for birthday's were a very good touch",,
for something a little bit different this is the place to go. Fantastic food and great entertainment for both adults and children.,,
"Don't like queueing so had to be persuaded to do that initially but to be fair we were in within 15minutes  Buzzy place, with friendly energetic waiting/bar staff and a big menu that everyone could find something on, the dances etc are a good touch, would recommend for something a little different during the holiday",,
portions so big you could feed a family of one dish great attentive waiters and waitress's italian and american menu good entertainment,,
Food was average but entertainment put on by serving staff certainly made it worth the visit.,,
"If you want to go somewhere that serves good food and vast amounts, then this is it, It also has singing and dancing waitresses. What more can you ask for",,
"My Husband & I went to Fat Mama's July 2011, see a large que outside so thought we would give it ago. We waited 15 minutes outside to be seated although tables inside were free for people to be seated, I am sure they do this so Fat Mama's draw attention to people passing by thinking well if there is a que the food & service must be great! We were seated, I agree with others the waitress/waiters were all running around chucking food & drinks at you, no personal attention what so ever, just interested in seating you, taking order & clearing you out for the next people all they can see is ££££ sign's. We had 8 different waitress/waiters attend to us & not one of them asked if everything was ok or if we needed anymore drinks. More interested in singing & dancing..well i'm sorry fat mama's but you can not do both! Your staff should be there to provide a service, not try to do x factor..The large size dinner is just a large plate with tiny bit of salad a little meat and filled with chips, could get that at KFC..Overall service was very poor & meal was over rated..would not return.",,
"Have visited a number of times over the last few years. Ate there again last night which will be the last time! Food is bland portion sizes appear large only because they overload the plate with fries, if you take that away very little is left on the plate to be honest.  Staff rush around like idiots more interested in trying to sing!! We must if had at least six waiters, one of which was in such a rush he nearly dropped my drink on the  table and then ran of and shouted ""Catch"", the average age if the serving staff would at a guess be 16 with little or no experience, walking around with plates if food trying to read the table numbers (staff training needed I think).  Anyway, our table of six finally got our mains only to discover two where missing! Ten minutes passed and another waiter noticed, came back from the kitchen and told us the grill had broken hence the delay on our two missing burgers, what he failed to realise is that we could see the kitchen from our table and could see other burgers being cooked! When this was pointed out he shrugged his shoulders and walked off.  As for the entertainment has the same routine, same songs, same staff and is crap to be honest.  Restaurant always looks busy but that's because they sit everybody at the front to force a quee outside.  Huge choice on the menu but simply many variations of the same thing.  All in all a very hot, stuffy, overpriced, poorly staffed and on a very busy main road so avoid and ignore the hype it really is Rubbish",,
"Visited fat mamas on 28.07.11 - this was our last meal of the holiday.    Ok food. Ok service. Not worth the hype.    Service was sporadic with different waiting staff throughout the meal, food not cooked as requested.    Many will say that people queue around the corner to come here - they do - that's because the staff are playing 'the game' - leave tables at the back empty and the front full to ensure a queue before allowing others to enter and be seated.    Also check your bill as the prices displayed for drinks on your table are different to those displayed on your bill - an old menu they will say !    Im sorry but not entirely sure what the fuss is all about.",,
"The restaurant goes out of its way to entertain, the kids will love the regular song and dance routines. For this, if you want to keep the kids quiet and happy for 90 minutes I would recommend the experience. Dont be afraid of the queue outside, they turn the tables quickly so the wait is not as long as the queue suggests. The portions of food are enormous, unless you are used to large food portions, I would avoid the starters. The negative for me was the food was just ok - texmex and italian. The kids ordered burger and ribs, I had fajitas. All the food was ok but I didnt walk away thinking the food was great, and considering it was the most expensive meal I had in Paphos, I expected better.",,
We've been going to Fat Mamas for many years - always a favourite with the children. The food is always good and the portions huge. We enjoy the dancing/singing waitresses however they are starting to take themselves a bit too seriously. They should stick to their old tongue in cheek fun rather than believing they are on Pop Idol.,,
"We had a great night here,food was good and plenty of it, entertainment was a hoot, well done to the staff you put on a great show.  Word of advice as other 's have said you get plenty of food on your plate,best missing the starters or better still share a starter.  Keep up the good work :) this was the only place we have seen on our trip that had people queing up every night to get in .  ps The choreographer for the entertainment what a beauty .",,
We ate here twice whilst we were on holiday. The portion sizes are massive so be warned if you're not a big eater ! Having said that quite a few meals on the menu offer a smaller portion size which is a great idea. I would definitely recommend the smaller portion if you want to try out one of their delicious desserts !! The entertainment took us by surprise but is good fun and livens things up. Fat Mama and Willy are good fun if you've got children ! We would definitely recommend eating here if you're going to Paphos on holiday.,,
"As part of a group of seven adults, we recently visited Cyprus for two weeks, eating out every night in various types of restaurant. This place was by far the best dining experience we had.  Food quality was excellent, portion sizes very generous, and attentive staff , who periodically entertain the clientele. My personal reccommendation would be the ribs, which are to die for, and some of the best i have ever tasted. Prices were very reasonable in our view. Well worth a visit, and if you go early ther is a discount offered.  It does get very busy, and they do not take reservations.",,
"Went here a couple of times. Entertainment was good, the place is great for kids. Portions size was huge but food itself was average and expensive compared to other places. Worth visiting but not worth queuing up for.",,
"The food is excellent, the staff are friendly, the portions are huge especially for the pasta dishes. Family friendly with cabaret style entertainment thrown in, overall great value and a fun evening.",,
"this place is a must food was amazing the portions was so big you wouldnt leave this place hungry,cant really fault this place we did have to wait to get a table because the staff did singing and dancing but was well worth watchin this,we enjoyed the food and entertainment so much we went back again and i will be going back again next time im over there and def would recomend to everyone",,
"Had a fantastic time again here. This time for our anniversary, the staff cannot do enough to make your evening special & memorable, they gave us a bottle of bubbly free for our anniversary. Food great & cannot fault this restaurant at all.",,
"Totally amazing restaurant Fat Mama's & Cowboy Willy's Rib-Ranch! A must if you visit Paphos it is centrally located on the Tomb of the Kings road.    The food is fantastic & the atmosphere and the entertainment shows throughout your meal is amazing, such a great family place to eat as well as couples. the few times I've been on holiday to Paphos this is the first main night out we have & generally visit once or twice, it is slightly prices in comparison to other restaurants but the quality & sheer size of the meals you can't complain. The staff are very attentive also & nothing too much.    If you have a special occasion they will make a fuss for you & make it very special.",,
"The atmosphere at this place is amazing! On arrival we had to wait for about 10 mins because it was so busy but when we got sat down it was nothing but brilliant. The food was so good and it cane quickly. They had a wide variety for all aswell. The entertainment by the staff was amazing, they did dances to dirty dancing, grease and more. The atmosphere was just brilliant. And if it's for a special occasion like a birthday or engagement they go out of their way to make it special. I think we went 4 times within 2 weeks.",,
"Visited Fat Mama's on the second night of our holiday after it was recommended to us by our travel agent. It more than lived up to the hype! The Menu was massive, but not quite as massive as the portion sizes. The hospitality was some of the best iv ever seen and for the quality and size of the meals you pay for, they were incredible value for money. Anyone who likes a tasty challenge has to try the Ribs, 24 delicious bbq ribs and a side of chips, I'm a big fan of eating an I couldn't finish them all. If when you visit there is a special occasion for someone in your group, like a birthday or anniversary then prepare for a fuss, I won't spoil it for anyone but they love special occasions at Fat Mama's.  I'd always recommend this restaurant to anyone, by far my favourite of all time; so much so that we went back another 2 times that week away.",,
"We decided to try this place out after a couple in our hotel recommend it they said watch out for the portions as they are massive but well worth it, the ribs one guy said gave him the meat sweats lol so funny however when we ordered them we now know why.    Anyway we ordered the ribs between the 2 of us as it was 2 full racks of ribs they were beautiful, we would recommend them. we did see the sizzling trays coming out massive again and the pasta dishes massive as well so what ever you choose bewear dont eat much that day.  The staff were ace we did make the mistake of telling them we were here to boo our wedding and they came out singing and dancing to going to the capel we got a free bottel of cheap fizz so very entertaining.    Every 20-30 mins they do a song normally for someones birthday its very entertaining great atmosphere kids and adults love it all.    If your into a quiet meal dont go here but if you up for a laugh then defo go here.    enjoy the ribs :)",,
"Went here twice with my mum in may11, it's just like frankie & bennys in the uk, Italian/American restaurant experience. Great menu, portion sizes are HUGE (recommend fajitas!) and staff entertain you at various intervals throughout the nite with renditions of broadway tunes & dance routines! Great fun night.",,
"Was told to go by some friends who had ate there b4 but only during the day when quite,  We went In the evening it was awful average burgers piled high with chips for expensive prices, annoying rude staff and pointless loud cabaret/ waitresses singing, at one point they turned every light in the building off so staff could bang in to tables while so called dancing to thriller,  The only reason this place has a que is because staff leave people queueing while they mince about trying to look busy. At one point an elderly lady tripped off a step and a staff member laughed  Would not recommend",,
"been to this restaurant every year for the 15 years, best food, best service in the whole country. owners Alex and Cathy are the best hosts for a great evening out .Only thing i would say is, do not eat for the whole day before you go, as the portions are huge.",,
"Go to ft mamas every year for last 5 years brilliant staff, entertainment, food and music. the staff are brilliant where would you that in the UK NOWHERE? thanks fat mamas keep it up",,
"Fat mama's is a must, we went for my girls 17th birthday, thay made her feel very special, got them to do her bithday cake, great big choc one it was and it only cost 20 auro plus thay sang a song from grease for her. Be warned the food is great big portions,my husband felt like fred flintstone when thay came out with his ribs,its not just a restarant its a full night out but make sure you book it gets very busy.",,
"went to fat mamas on my 50th birthday with some friends, had a great evening food, wine and entertainment excellent",,
"Each night we walked past this – there was a queue, and a very lively atmosphere so we had to give it a try. Most nights the kids were treated to Face painting and on one night there were ‘character’ entertainers. I had Chicken and sweetcorn pizza and a monster Cherry Pancake, my wife had steak diane and a strawberry sensation. There is a choice of large or small sized pizzas and plenty of Burger choices.  We scored them out of 10; Food 9; Service 9; Ambience 9 and Overall Value for Money 9. Our bill was 43.30 euros.",,
The restaurant is pleasant enough but the main thing i.e the food is sub standard  servings are just stacked with chips and the food tastes awful.  The entertainment is worse than anything I have seen brash waiters doing 2 minute shindigs.  Dont waste your time going here!,,
"We enjoyed our evening at Fat Mamas, the service was excellent and the entertainment interesting but even the small portions were large and the available huge portions encouraged overeating. One sensible size portion would be better all around. There was no chocolate cake left but we could see plates being cleared with left over cake on because they couldn't manage the portion size. Ribs could have been better too.Food was very average.Shame as the place is different.",,
"Our 4 meals including 2 kids were all way too over padded with chips, mundane and with little or no veg(63euros).  The queue to get in is manufactured. We stood with others for 5mins when there was clearly set tables of various sizes free and plenty of staff available to take you to them and serve.  Funny how queue size constantly stayed about 4groups/couples/families. Looks impressive for passing trade of course.  The 'entertainment' was tatty and thankfully lasted only 45 secs both times.  Not bad if you like paying alot of money for chips, if not KFC is a short walk away.",,
"We were taken to Fat Mama's by friends that live in Cyprus. They told us it is the most popular restaurant in Paphos and when we were there we found out why.  Located on Tomb of the Kings Road, we arrived there for a 7.30pm sitting to find a queue in to the street, thankfully some of our party were already there so we could just go right in. They do take bookings up until 7.30pm which you need to do by e-mail or in person - no phone reservations, otherwise, turn up and queue.  The restaurant was packed and the staff were providing a great atmosphere. They have two separate menu's, one American/Mexican and one Italian. The portions were huge and ever so tasty, if you are in to ribs make sure you get them, biggest portion I have ever seen. Also recommend the fajitas (steak or chicken) and the pizza's are lovely and light.  Every now and then, members of staff would burst in to song and dance in the middle of the restaurant which was very entertaining, then they would make their way to diners who were celebrating birthdays, weddings etc and would have the whole place joining in. Lots of fun. Also, anytime someone passed compliments to the chef, waiting staff would shout it to the kitchen and all staff would cheer. There was also an appearance by fat mama herself! With all of the extra carricular staff activities, there was no compromise on service or quality.    We can't wait to return next year.",,
"I've lived in Paphos for 5 years and never been to this restaurant. Having had a drink over the road thought to go with my fiancé and 2 friends. The starters came fairly quick but the main course took a long time. I ordered chicken fajitas, they came with tortillas and some very bland sauce and mcdonalds Style under cooked chips. The chicken was purely part cooked chicken with onions and peppers with soy sauce! I didn't eat it as it was so bland so I told the waiter to take it back he did and the duty manger came over and said if you are not happy then why did you come here and I suggest you don't come back!!! Never has anyone talked to me in a place where I pay hard earned money to dine!! If your after a one off meal that I hit or miss with the food and a tacky performance of dancing then be prepared for flitting your money away. I've never in my life sent back meal the one time I did with honesty I got abuse back!!!!!",,
